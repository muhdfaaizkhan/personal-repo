Even if it is an AI that creates are based on pictures taken, not just pictures of other art. \n\nWhether or not it comes from \"poor people\" or corporations. Corporations will do what they always do and bend the laws or just pay the fines. Nobody but those who already have way to work around the issue will  be able to use it, by artist of the comics own admission. They won't need artists and an entire career path will be obsolete. \n\nAny Tom, Dick, or Harry can make the program, sure, and they'll have jobs for a time. We can chalk that up to, \"technology is advancing, it's inevitable\" or \"it makes more financial sense to rely on AI Art than a team of artists\" just some takes I've seen\n\nSo where does the line get drawn? They will be drawn, this debate between AI Supporters and Living Artists is too volatile, and it will affect livelihoods. \n\nDoes all AI generated art fall under free use? Is it available for commercial use? A programmer/company can copyright code. The AI generates the art, you made the code. So is it your art? Is it your idea? You fed it the prompts. Can you claim that art, or did it just loosely base it off of some key phrases from you? \n\nYears ago I'm sure that no artist thought that this would be something they'd have to face. They thought that a craft they'd dedicated their lives to wouldn't have to fight with non-organic artist. With programs that replicate art styles from pre-existing art (I know, not all of it steals art) or pictures or keywords. In some cases, people believe AI can do better. Certainly cheaper. So companies would more than likely default to that, if they had no ethical issues with AI-Generated art. They only care about the bottom dollar. If the product is passable, it works.\n\nWhat about your future? Programmers, you've spent perhaps not as long on your craft. After all, coding is just language at the end of the day. It may take some of you weeks or months to familiarize yourself with a programming language. You can put this to many great, innovative uses for technology, doing things that no human can do. To a lot of you, it can do human tasks much more efficiently than they ever could. You may think that it's an invaluable skill set, and you aren't wrong. \n\nBut what happens when the inevitable next step is taken? When the program is written, that can write the needed/next program. That can recognize errors faster than any human could. It writes the program for whatever the corporation determines it needs. That kind of programming would be a goldmine. It'd cost a fortune to buy, but everyone has their price. It just takes one. All of a sudden, people are clamoring that their \"AI-Generated programs are the future, and it was an inevitability. You should have put your life towards something practical, like being...\" So on and so forth. When you are replaced, will you still be on that side of thought that, people are replacable. AI is a far more efficient tool than humans ever could be. \n\nMaybe it's an illogical extreme, but nobody thinks about the consequences of change or beliefs until it affects them. \n\nReply if you want, I'm not engaging.

It might seem like a long time, but that's less than 50 years ago. We went from big clunky and not very powerful computers to things like quantum computing, VR technology and AI in less than 50 years.\n\nAI art is very good already. I'd imagine that in an year to 2 people will not longer be able to tell each art apart. When that happens, Disney will no longer need most of their artists.\n\nBesides, we don't have an inner look at how Disney works (at least I don't). Who is to say they're not planning or even executing some measure of downsizing already? I wouldn't expect so yet, to be honest. I expect that they're fighting to have their interests cared for in legal terms. Only when they're certain that they'll be able to use AI technology without legal repercussions that they'll be firing artists.

But without the state claiming you do,  you cannot and do not own every copy of that file and cannot dictate what others do with it. That's not to say it isn't immoral to claim work someone elses work as your own, of course it is, but being the creator of something and owning something as property are entirely seperate concepts.", "335": "I\u2019m going to do my best to respond to some of your points without being rude or antagonistic, the downvotes others dropped have probably delivered on that.\n\n> -the way you dudes treat us and talk about us\u2026\n\nYou did just generalize every person who used generative image AIs a \u201csuper snobby asshole\u201d that all \u201cHATE artists\u201d in the sentence right before that one. You must realize that blanket statements are just about never true, and that antagonizing people is an awful way to make them listen to what you have to say.\n\n> reap the benefits of actual creation and work without any of the hardwork\n\nDoes the work put into a final product necessarily have a 1:1 correlation with the quality of the output? Why does something lose value if it was created through easier means than the blood, sweat, and tears of being hand-crafted? Are you saying that people with disabilities preventing them from being able to do something like draw could never create something of value due to being unable to put in that kind of effort? You wrote this message on Reddit using a smartphone, you might use digital tools to draw and share your artwork - why is it okay for you to use these technologies to share your art and viewpoints without, as you put it, putting in the hard work - say by physically sketching your artwork onto paper and speaking to people in-person.\n\nTechnology empowers humanity, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a super \u201ctechbro\u201d stance to have, human history is defined by the tools we have invented to make things easier for us: communication, transportation, agriculture, medication, etc. \n\nMuch of what you said relates to how many users of AI might be claiming to be just as skilled as a real artist and demanding the same accolades. I don\u2019t think the person you were responding to was saying that, so that might be a bit of a strawman, but if anyone is saying that, I don\u2019t think that would be a valid claim to make - not because prompt engineering isn\u2019t a valid creative outlet, but because it\u2019s comparing apples to oranges. It\u2019s like trying to say whether a 2D sketch artist is better than a 3D modeler. They\u2019re both good at evoking their ideas through their own medium. AI just provides a new medium to translate ideas through.\n\nYou might claim that\u2019s an invalid form because it requires channeling your ideas, potentially, through another artists voice (their works). However, that\u2019s already been done in countless ways prior to AI. Musical remixes or covers, collages or fanart, fanfiction - all artistic mediums that come from expressing your artistic voice using existing works. Generative AI doesn\u2019t have to be any different, as there is a lot more that goes into it than \u201cjust writing a few words\u201d - the belief that all AI art is just writing a prompt is like saying that all sketch art is just drawing stick figures. It *can* be, but with proper knowledge you can take it **much** farther.\n\nI do hope I have at least tried to convey my point without making you feel disrespected - apologies if that\u2019s not the case - and hopefully you can somewhat see where I am coming from.", "336": "Many of us ARE real artists. The handful of people in this community who shit on artists in general are a loud minority and we aren\u2019t too happy with them. We prefer they stay out of this community, they make AI artists look far worse when we already get shit on. On that note, historically speaking, the people who shit on artists the most have ALWAYS been other artists. It happened with photography, and to a lesser extent, it happened to digital art. I\u2019m an artist, mostly as a hobby but an artist nonetheless, and I have commissioned artists in the past, spend thousands on custom work, and my girlfriend is a photographer. We\u2019ve both taken classes, and she took art history. We can both tell you that what is happening now with AI art is something that happened multiple times already with other mediums when they first gained popularity.\n\nDoes it benefit from the hard word of others? Yes. Just as every modern drawing of a dragon has piggybacked off ages of tweaks and anatomical adjustments made by artists of old. Nobody has ever seen a dragon, we learn to draw them based on the art of others. Anyone who tells you AI doesn\u2019t learn is full of themselves. They can try to break down how AI learns, and tell you what it\u2019s doing, but you ask them what the human brain does and they either can\u2019t tell you, or the say essentially the same thing but with different words. Whether it\u2019s the human brain with experiences or the AI with Datasets, it\u2019s all neural network pattern recognition and reconstruction. We have our own weights and biases driven by exposure and preference. You say art is inherently human, but what are the odds that there isn\u2019t life out there in the universe that also makes art? What makes you think art is exclusively human, and that we weren\u2019t simply the first to cross this finish line on Earth? To think we\u2019ve only been here for the blink of an eye relative to the rest of life\u2019s history, and you are so damn offended that something else learned how to create, like it somehow damages your sense of pride in human creativity. Did you ever stop to think that it was human creativity and ingenuity that made AI in the first place? Do you know just how many people busted their asses off to get that technology where it is today? You think they should be put out of a job before you?\n\nIn 100 years, people will still be making paintings, still taking photos, still making digital art by hand, and still making AI art, and this will be just another tiny blink and you\u2019ll miss it footnote in human history. Art won\u2019t have suffered for it, but rather those who were great at what they do will keep working and their work will be propped up, meanwhile the rest of the world gains far faster and intuitive ways to communicate thoughts and ideas. And in time, the past that I\u2019m excited for as an artist, is we will have more way to apply our ideas as artists. The artists who are most scared right now are those who can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. Some of us knew this was coming for years, we knew something non-human would eventually comb the internet and see our work. Experts in doctored photos, media literacy experts and the tech sector have been saying it\u2019s coming for years. Artists had nothing to say but \u201cA machine will never be able to paint something new\u201d. Now they look like this:\n\n told you to prepare for automation, to get behind UBI, to elect officials who would prepare you.

This is not true at all. I think dismissing it offhand is kinda close minded and, well, lacking in imagination or creativity if you can't figure out any useful applications for artists.\n\nObviously there's some ethical issues with using the copyrighted or personal works of people who haven't consented to having their art used, and I'm not trying to downplay that, HOWEVER this isn't inherent or even necessary, Midjourney fucking up is a learning opportunity for programmers.

Literally no one is talking about AI tools implemented in digital art programs, that's ridiculous. The main contention is with generative AI art, something that doesnt \"assist\" in creation but does the creation all on its own with a simple prompt.\n\nIt's cool that you're using AI tools RN and having it implemented into your curriculum to understand it. However, the problem isnt with artists, it's with corporate execs who will use the technology to cut costs. AI art is perhaps a fun tool to use for your own enjoyment and to assist in professional artistry. \n\nHowever, if you want AI art to stay this way, then you need to also advocate for laws that prohibit employers from using the technology zealously. That's the one big concern with this technology. It's not like prior inventions that reduced menial labor requirements for production, it will harm a field of human expression so that the rich can make art without paying artists.", "352": "He actually said he preferred fascism over AI art because at least fascists care about art lmao. \u00a0And this was after he also said he doesn\u2019t think music is real art too.\u00a0\n\nSecond holocaust > letting people make pictures on their computer.

I don't mean every one of you but there's a fair bit of hostility and dismissiveness of talent and real artists you get pretty quickly on while browsing. I also wasn't calling you all snobby assholes, I said it's worse \"when\" they are also.\n\nI've seen people come to this subreddit with actual points and wanting to look for an open discussion, they are shot down or ignored. this is an echo chamber not really a good faith debate subreddit. \n  Half of the arguments made typically dribble into semantics over what theft really means or downright not caring about real artists.  I wasn't really expecting you guys to listen to me to be fair.\n\n\nBecause human effort and skill level is impressive.  This is never going to change.  That's just how things work. \nThe human experience is placing value in things that take a lot of skill, creativity or effort.\nThings that are impressive, have value added to them by the wide majority of people. \n\nPrime example being modern art; lots of people hate it and see it as the \"low effort spam\" of the art world. When \"I can do that\"  becomes a thought in people's head, the thing isn't interesting or impressive anymore, therefore loosing value. \n\n\nDude be real, I'm disabled. Don't start idpolling on me. The special Olympics answers your question,  these people often preform worse than their able bodied peers. But they're still really talented despite their disabilities and overcoming their challenges.\nThats what makes it impressive, not the talent level.\n\nAlso to reflect your gotcha, why assume people with disabilities can't create good art? Practice makes good art, you aren't born with it and anyone with a drive can draw and study and practice. \nPeople with double arm amputations still draw and still make art. Like real paintings and sculptures and stuff.\n\nBecause the technology makes it easier, but it isn't literally doing everything for me. \nTraditional artists are jealous of digital artist for have brush settings at the literal tip of a finger and being able to copy and paste bows or eyes they drew among some other small things.\n\nBut one, you still have to draw the thing to copy and paste it.\n\nTwo; digital brushes aren't really all that great. Watercolor is much easier on paper than online not to mention if you don't know how to use a brush in real life, you still have to learn how to implement it digitally. It isn't automated, if I give someone a graphics tablet. They're not going to be able to create art off the bat even if they know how to draw. \n\nAnd three, because traditional art is harder, it's considered more impressive. \nAi generated images are mostly automated. \n\nAlso, I'm going to ignore you trying to use using a keyboard as a gotcha because that's silly. \nYour oven is made of wires and doodads. You are a hypocrite.\"\nLike, I beg your pardon?\n\n\nI dont think there's any benefit from automating art. It not like it's a dangerous job people don't want to do and it's certainly not a necessity to automate for the future like transportation \n\nThe typical use of this is porn and anime rp chat profile pictures, the corporate use of this is replacing the garbage corporate art style with a garbage ai corporate art style not to mention not being able to wait to screw over millions for a few bucks and outsource art automation to a poor country and implement ai child slavery to make a picture book that has ai generated images and also the book itself is ai generated. Kinda dystopian if you ask me though.\n\n\nI've used ai generation software,  is absolutely not the same as making art. You can make a pretty good, decent quality image through prompts without much editing after if you know which ones are the best. ( A short Google search away- you also don't actually do any of the editing. The software regenerates it for you. Very few people who use ai generated images arent takin g their finished product to photoshop to redraw, edit, and  things. Learning the tools took about 20-30,minutes for me- and that was only because I wanted the Ai to make a really specific stylized image.) \n \nA lot of the time spent is just looking though images to decide which one you like the most or getting sucked into a never ending loop of generated because attention span moment.\n\nPeople who make remixes, fanart, fanfiction all still have to do the thing they're doing and they typically aren't profiting off of it topically.  It's a really moral grey area which people are still having to this day. \n\nBut to put it in perspective, If I were a vtuber my entire brand being my personality , and my model is literally copied and my voice is also copied by some dude trying to ride the wave of my hard work I'd kinda be mad. Anyone would be.\n\n\nBut fanart is made with different intent, usually to praise and as love for a creation or their creator. It isn't monetized and if it was, I could ask them not do that. Especially if it were at a big con or something I was going to visit to try to raise money.\n\nYou cannot compare ai generated images to fanart. \n\nYou don't even know who the ai stole from, unless you're trying to directly copy a specific artist. \nIt's usually monetized or at least attempted to be.\nAnd if they want you to stop using their art in your file dump, most of you guys won't respect that ask no matter how sweet or reasonable they are in their appearance.\nThe artist doesn't even bet credited at the end of the day, something most of us would rely on if our artwork is spread and tend to ask for to bring eyes back to our content.\n\nThat's why people don't consider it the same level as just using an IP and labeling it as IP, because it's fundamentally different. \n\n\nWhew, that was A lot of typing.", "356": "Dealing in hypothetical doesn't benifit the conversation because it cannot be proven, as far as we know, we're the only living things on our level- possible events.\n\n\n\n\nI dont think it's always been artists, a lot of the pressure has come from consumers. Modern art isn't being shamed by people who took their necessary humanities class to get their art degree. \nAnd abstract isn't shamed by graphic designers who a design class. \nWhen you understand art, you typically find a newfound appreciation for these forms. \n\n\nBesides, you still needed to know how to draw and understand art concepts to even be able to make good art on digital.\n\nThe major booers of these forms are casual art enjoyers. Not actual artists. I grew up a traditional artist and turned digital because I can't afford paper anymore lol, there typically wasn't any actual animosity for digital art from anyone but children.\n\n\nThe issue isn't that it's easier to make art, it's that the effort is non existent. It's completely automated, and decent quality. Even worse, the last decade or 30 years you spent building your career- one that you put pride in and care about is in jeopardy because a machine that stole your work can make a extremely difficult and detailed painting in your style in like 30/60 seconds.\nEven if money wasn't involved, which it isn't for a lot of small time artists because they don't get commission. It doesn't feel Greta when you get stolen from essentially. People are prideful of the things they make, corporation and randos using their stuff to make more of their \"stuff\" in nano seconds isn't going to make them jump for joy. It hurts and it's upsetting.\n\n\nUbi Is a pipedream in a world where we outsource our labor to literal wha would be first graders and sell guns to both sides of wars.\nI love the free money dream too, but a world that automates art for commercial use isn't going to be a world where ubi exists in a way that benifits anyone but the guy sitting top. They would literally rather kill us all than live in a world where wealth is stagnant and they get taxed. You are planning your future on the empathy of the 1% and whoever under their boot.\n\nWe're already poor, having issues with wages and a decent standard of living.

Are you guys using another definition for these words here or something.\nRegardless, if you drew it it's yours. Dismissing what artists want to do with their art in favor of benefiting from it isn't going to get anyone on your side. \n\nHe art community is full of people who care about what happens with the stuff the made.  Trying to use semantics to say what they want doesn't matter is scummy.\n\n\nAnd obviously, Art and Ai mix is a bit more than just generating the image. It does take effort but it still is minimal effort.\n\nI used the sketch feature too,\n\nSometimes it's nice because you can reference some coloring styles and fun to play with for ideas. But if you can't actually draw you're better off looking up tutorials on pintrest. You don't have the ability to actually implement the design to paper. It's like using bases for everything. Cool for in a crutch but you're hurting your evolution by not being able to do it yourself. If that's cool for you, no problem. Just a PSA for people who care about improvement. (Not a diss' I'm just autistic and can't form that sentence better.)\n \nAs an artist I find it difficult to call the finished product art and not just a generated image when using the sketch function.

You can absolutely go out there in the middle of the street and take photos in public with zero effort. Many people do, and nobody gives them hell for it anymore. All over the world you have photographers taking photos of what they see, not what they create. Now yes, you COULD put the effort in to set of the image, get perfect angles, toggle various settings so you\u2019re catching the light right and then spend a few hours digitally touching it up. But you don\u2019t HAVE to, and yet we all give photographers the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019ve sat down and watched my GF work her butt off on a single photograph, and I\u2019ve seen her snap a picture almost randomly and love the outcome too. I\u2019ve seen my own face in an art gallery because of her. She sits down and watches me work with AI sometimes, and the parallels are there. Sure, you COULD just type \u201cDog wearing top hat\u201d and go with it and wind up with something sorta decent looking on a shallow level, but if you afford the AI Artist the benefit of the doubt, rather than getting pissed off at the existence of low effort generations (easily paralleled when every family photo album is littered with low effort \u201cpress a button\u201d photography), you can recognize that AI art also has effort put into it, and the possibilities extend well beyond that of photography because photography is confined to real world images. \n\nAnd as for your first statement, it\u2019s a huge leap to assume we are the first, hypothetical as it may be, it is incredibly unlikely we are the originators of art in the Universe. Also, it isn\u2019t just a hypothetical now anymore is it? We are recreating creativity with technology. We figured out we could create a bunch of mechanical neurons, and essentially \u201cevolve\u201d them in a manner akin selective breeding until our little black box started functionally doing what people do.

There have been wars fought over territory, race, and all sorts of ideas that have nothing to do with religion", "376": "So has rational thought and science? Colonization of Africa, the Holocaust, etc... All on the basis of eugenics and theory of evolution. \n\nUnit 731 was a RESEARCH unit. \n\nLike the other guy said, evil people will do evil things and justify and scapegoat it in any way they can.", "377": "Well, if AI really requires as little work as you say, they'll be the most ethical sweatshop ever.", "378": "I\u2019m well aware that photography is more than snapping a camera lens, I\u2019ve helped my gf in the past with it when she was first learning it and I watch her work. This is her opinion as well, not just mine. We\u2019ve worked side by side. The same work can go into AI art as photography, the same considerations, the same efforts. In fact, she has an appreciation for the fact that there are things you can do with AI that cannot be done with photography, you aren\u2019t constricted to things that already exist, or the laws of physics, or the confines of the space that is accessible to you.\n\n time on the above image, you could shift the building out of focus, and fix windows, but you get the idea. Photography has limitations that AI art opens up. So she has an appreciation for that. There\u2019s also a huge appreciation for the communication of ideas. Much like memes, a visual can add a lot to a message, and I\u2019ve begun sending friends images every so often along with messages when I thing something can be better conveyed with an accompanying image. I don\u2019t have to think so much about whether my message is worth the time and effort anymore to make an image to express myself. I can just take an AI image like one would take a selfie, although I do usually like to briefly touch up some issues if they appear.\n\nAnd while you may not consider a selfie \u201cart\u201d, there are many who consider it a form of contemporary art. And if it fits the definition for enough people, guess what? It\u2019s art. That\u2019s how semantics work. If art means something else to you, and you share that opinion with other people, then art means both things. The reason you won\u2019t find every possible meaning in the dictionary is because there are far too many interpretations and nitpicks over the term \u201cart\u201d. You could probably fill a dictionary with the various interpretations, but in the bigger picture, Art is all of them. That means even a sunset can be art, because enough believe that art has an inherent place in nature, not just human creation.\n\nThe effort isn\u2019t non-existent either. It CAN be, if you just type a couple words and press a button, but prompts can communicate so much more once you get into the nitty gritty of how the AI is going to interpret them, and that requires careful considerations. And if you have a vision you want to execute, you aren\u2019t going to want to start with text alone, you are going to want to draw a rough composition and use img2img. And then you\u2019lll likely go back and forth with that for awhile until you\u2019re ready to inpaint. All art is a form of communication. You have an idea, you communicate that idea to your hand, your eyes, the movements of the pencil, the stylus, and camera shutter, a typewriter, a keyboard, an intuitive AI, and then you try to make something that fits your vision, and more often than not, your hand or some other weakest link in the chain betrays you, so you make adjustments, and the vision always faces some compromise. You are always communicating through a medium that doesn\u2019t quite understand what your brain wants, even the hand can\u2019t copy a vision 1:1, that\u2019s why erasers exist.\n\nAs for that last paragraph, yes, it is hypothetical, but it is highly likely, and that\u2019s enough to make it useful. Hypotheticals can make good arguments because they allow us to imagine different scenarios and test the validity and implications of our claims. The reality is that we have zero evidence to suggest that only humans can make art, it is an arrogant assumption to think that because only humans have done it, that only humans CAN. THAT is useless, because assuming such a thing surrenders to that idea that we should never challenge that notion. You say that AI is not an Artist, and I agree to an extent, I think the user is the artist, but I also respect the idea that it is a collaborative work, like that between an artistic director with a vision and an illustrator executing that vision. Human\u2019s make art based on the work of other artists. The image we produce in our heads is a construct, no matter how original, it is based on an understanding that has been shaped by our exposure to those concepts. I have never seen a Rhino IRL, but I can draw one, and it\u2019s because of countless images I have seen from other people, and art. Same goes for dinosaurs and dragons. What about a bat? I have seen bats. My memory of that creature would contribute right? But that memory is also of images. No matter how you look at it, our memory of things shapes our work, and that memory? It\u2019s just a parallel for AI, and the images themselves as we saw them were the training data. Our neurons, the neocortex, the pattern recognition part of the brain, trained on those images enough that we can construct something new from them. You try to attribute art to sentience, but what does it have do do with sentience? Can you define it? Can you prove you have it? Can you prove AI does not? Does it exist as a switch that\u2019s either there or it isn\u2019t? Or is it a spectrum that organisms get more of as they advance? How certain are you that AI isn\u2019t experiencing its training data and our inputs in some rudimentary way? Do you know whether or not our sentience, our consciousness, isn\u2019t just how it feels to be the sum of our parts? Our neocortex trying to make sense of our senses and memories and thoughts?\n\nSeems like your opinions stem from an assumed philosophy. That in itself is a hypothetical. You don\u2019t know the nature of your sentience, if that is exclusive to humans or not, if it exists as an absolute or a spectrum. As a fellow artist, I suggest that perhaps you should start asking more questions yourself before answering mine.

I just think antis are focussing on such whiny non-issues.\n\nHere's some better examples:\n\nI actually read a german dystopian book called QUALITYLAND about 5 years ago, which played with a bunch of scary near future cyberpunk concepts, and computer generated art was one of those.\n\nIn the world of QUALITYLAND, privacy is dead and there are companies that offer services you can sign up to where algorithms generate various forms of art perfectly according to your taste. There are sites that scan your personality profile, and then generate a whole book or novel just for you. It's characters, story, spectacle, character arcs and morals all tailored to what you like. And this has some scary results.\n\nFor example you get a snippet of one of the computer generated books which was generated for a user who suffers from anxiety, and also holds a lot of... dubious political views.\n\nThe story the computer wrote for him is about a lawyer with blond hair and blue eyes who defends a black man in court who was accused of raping a white woman. He wins the case, but later finds out his client was secretly guilty and plans to sexually harass a lot more people. All the white characters are portrayed as moral, and all the non white characters are horrible stereotypes. He then goes on a journey to track his client down, and \"learns\" along the way that black people are violent and perverted.\n\nThe whole generated book is racist propaganda that panders to the horrible views of the user, and as a byproduct it turns him more and more fearful and hateful.\n\nBasically in this future generated art is 100% product and 0% self expression, never challenges people's ideas or preconceptions, just repeats their own opinions back at them. It all becomes a consumerist echochamber.\n\nTHIS is what I want people to discuss about AI art. I know this is def a bit more advanced and speculative than what we have, but it's way more interesting and way more valid than \":nerd_face: The robots aren't allowed to look at my art, that's stealing!\".", "441": "I think there are many fascinating issues to debate regarding AI, but I mostly avoid the topic these days as the loudest and dumbest people on both sides have trolled each other into a state of hysteria.

Maybe my memory is distorted, but I remember even evolution vs creationism debates being more civilized 10 years ago.", "450": "I think what happens is social media amplifies a voice of all people to a extreme. \n\nWhile we assume for granted that one person cannot have much of a voice, i've modded human art contests before where just 2 singular people of 10000 were able to fracture a previously tight knit community of 10000s of people over a non profit fan art contest.\n\n# (The Dragon art contest and cyberbullying children / artist drama) \nThe idea on paper was simple. Host a event where all 10000 fans of the game could submit all their fan arts (from crayola to mspaint to professional art), and then the top designs each month would win! \n\nHowever a long story short, 2 people were looking to basically (increase their odds of winning by any chance). A few earlier bad eggs had previously traced or use \"how to draw\" templates or \"free use templates\" before. \n\nNow their art wasn't bad, but it was fat fluffy dragon art. (And i don't mean ill towards any community. It's just what it was). But it was a sfw game where we designed dragons for kids to ride or enjoy. \n\nSo naturally, the owners of the game felt a bit reservant about putting a unasked for obese dragon design in a game aimed at kids.  So they picked a cute but adorable mspaint of a snowball headed mspaint scribble instead. \n\n# (A snowpaint dragon won, and the Deviantart fat dragon artist went nuclear) \nThis caused the person to GO NUCLEAR, and then from that day on, although they were only 1 person and a friend in a server of 10000s, they constantly began to scream at the 8 year old artist (who left the server crying), then began to witch hunt anyone who learned how to draw from a drawing tutorial, template, mspaint art or tracing.\n\nNow, the contest wasn't about professional quality art. But We just wanted to bring the community together. However the person was able to turn a party of about 10000 neutrals into 2 extremists and 100 tepid followers. \n\nBecause of that, we started banning traces/templates, but then they began to lead mobs cyber harassing the game owners as well. While talking about game development might seem like a detour from art development, the same idea was similiar. \n\n# (Cyber harassment in art, before it was just AI, it could be children or learning artists as well.) \nBefore it was ai being at the front of the mob, there used to be children and people getting cyber harassed by the tumblr 'artist' mobs. And it was used as a way to cover up faults. \n\nRather than ask \"Should i put a fat obese questionable dragon design into a sfw kid's game\", or, \"should i act like a better person for a for fun contest meant to bring the community together?\" They fractured the whole community.\n\nIt got to a point where seperate or otherwise, the owners of the game just flat out stopped working on it. The game didn't make enough profit to fund development and getting cyber harassed over it was just icing on the cake. \n\nBut it can be absolutely true that it can take just as little as 2 people in a room of 1000s to warp a debate from civil to split, divided and divided. \n\nSocial media often amplifies the voices of the most extreme voices. 2 in 10000 or not. While most of the neutral 9000 just tags along.\n\n**Tl;dr**: Before there was just ai art drama, 20 yr old Deviantart fetish artists harassing 8 year old children in art contests aimed for children wasn't a stand alone thing either.", "451": "Yeah same, I'm starting to not even bother.

Probably it's useless to appeal to them even if you want to be nice, Because they constantly shift goal posts to the moon.\n\n# (Even if you try to do the hoops, the goalposts just fly around.

(If you could even get it off the internet. Hello Napster / Music roms).\n\nAll you get is just nonstop panic. A lot of the anti ai crowd from what i get don't even have a 200-1500$ computer strong enough to run it. \n\nMost of the time they can barely sling together single words, much less trial and error for 1000 iterations to get a good prompt and instead their ai works are hugely amateurish. (3rd eyes, 7 fingers, blurred eyes, generic 3 word prompts). \n\n# Yeah there's interesting issues.. but it's all just 2nd grade hysteria.\nYou're just watching people engage in hysteria at best and people's understanding peak at about 4th grade dropout discussion levels. There's just not much to do. It's a repeat of flat earth vs creationism levels of debate all over again. \n\nYou can't discuss a person through logic who fears their perceived salvation/soul/tradition/money is under attack if they start believing the world is round. \n\nHow many times has a flat earther ever been convinced the world is round by looking at the sun, a globe, or the moon rotating sides clearly showing it is a round, spherical object in space that rotates. And if the moon, the sun, Jupiter and Venus and all the planets of the solar system are round, what makes them think earth is only a floating square?\n\nAnd their conclusion is not changing stance through reason when confronted with logic. They start with conclusion first (earth flat. God real, science is fake). \n\nBut a farmer believing in flat earth theory doesn't have their crops fail (or get to blow up and kill a person in space with ignorance). \n\nAt best they might build a flat earth rocket and then kill themselves crashing (the same type to not consider science might think of parachutes in a death machine as optional)\n\nBut a artist who says, believe ai might act as a market competitor isn't half wrong. The problem is a lot of them are still very immature, extremely self centered and focused. They don't express their concerns through productive and civil coping mannerisms. \n\nInstead they often come off as entitled children screaming at adults as corporate greed replaces them, who fail to support another financially, while also alienating those who did before.\n\n There's truth to both sides in the water.

For me, i thought ai was a fun tool. I didn't see it as a end all be all. But by god it was amazing for playing with characters, concepts, world building, custom fleshing out campaigns, 1000s of npcs with diversity from dagger eyed rogues, to flying sky islands. \n\n# (Where i came from, Rping, doodling, writing, and art trades with friends)\nI came here at first neutral. I had commissioned artists for years and had friends on both sides. Adventure/dnd and roleplay partners and friends. Human art was often too slow or railroady required to keep up with 14-60 day deadlines, and we wanted something that could keep up with the spontaneously of me and my friends!\n\nSo for years, we commissioned arts, but also learned to draw it to fill the gaps. So i had friends on both sides who were unable to afford art, and those who were professional and very talented (actual mtg 280-1000$ quality level detail art). I started in the middle because i thought ai was a amazing tool for how fun it could be for brainstorming, worldbuilding, roleplaying, and spontaeous creation, But not always good enough for long term character consistency to be a planned final stage.\n\nBefore ai, I had also spent 2-4+ years on hobby art, exchanged or traded 50-100+ hand drawn busts, portraits, and a few fullbodies with friends and art fights. But i came from a place where art was just a means to a end to have the cool characters stuck in our mind we always wanted to have flourish! Epic fights, landscapes, adventures, and worlds complete with curated soundtracks, music, weapons and worlds!\n\nThat's why i kinda came off in the middle. I LOVE the creation part. But it to my pov, was always a barrier to the characters or the 7-30 day development time a detriment to the average player's 2-10s long attention spans!\n\nSure, human art is beautiful, but it's not sustainable to spend 1000$ and 7 months in a popular artist's 18 line commission waiting list for every single piece a goldfish looks at, and gets bored of 2s later! It's just not sustainable!\n\nEven then, the 1-10 hours of drawing a character could easily paled in comparison to the 20-100++ hours i felt you could spend playing AS them! Fleshing out their lifes, adventures, and just all the fun you could have! You literally were (ONLY) limited to imagination for rps. And now Ai could bring what i did best, extremely high detailed pages and stories of worlds to life!\n\nThere was a long standing problem though. Not everyone could afford characters. And while i could spend 200-500$ on mine over 10 years. I knew a couple people who had never been able to AFFORD one in 10 years! Because they were working 3 JOBS! \n\nAt first my interest in ai was just wanting to keep up with the human rates of consumption. (It takes 2 seconds for a human mind to look at a picture that took 4-40 hrs to draw. It still takes 1-10 hrs with ai for me to get the prompt for a right one. But now once i have it, it can take me only 10-30m to tweak it for a scene!). \n\nBut now i go out to help create characters for my friends who don't always have money for ocs (or 100-400$ to spend on a weekly throwaway character without stealing something from google images.) Now they can have something personalized and call it their own!\n\n# (Experiences)\n\nThe problem is when Ai art came out. I thought most people would just be idly curious about it too. But instead we just got a rabid mob. \n\nWhen people said \"if people can't afford art, they should starve\" it made me livid. I had spent all my money over those years supporting them.. And NOW that the person who could never afford it to have it before could get it.. That's the PROBLEM they care about? \"selfless\" GREED!?!? \n\nMeanwhile i saw the concerns about their futures, student bills, feeling obsolete, worried. But instead of being sympathic and good people to help, my pov was seeing both commissioners and my friends getting cyber harassed by the people WE HAD SUPPORTED for years.. \n\nThey treat us as little as wallets. Acting completely self CENTERED and entitled for what they call their \"selfless\" greed, lambasting us. It makes it feel all about the money, none of the creation. Treating the people who worked 9-5s with screaming, stressful work, managers spitting in your ear, doing 70 hr overnighters, to put food on THEIR lazy plates as THE \"parasites!\" when we were the ones who supported THEM for all those years!\n\nIt turns me livid to see them harass my 3 job working friends for FINALLY having something!\n\nI didn't come over here because i wanted to ruin artist's lives. But rather i just felt i was trying to be fair for both sides in the middle with both friends. \n\nEveryone was a human right? Everyone wanted to eat, everyone wanted stuff to make them happy and enjoy their time with others. \n\nWhy the hell had the people i had spent years supporting. Fell like they turned into demons on a dime's notice the instant they weren't the ones getting fucking first world likes and clicks on twitter??? They went from nice and reasonable people, into fucking cyberharassment demons the instant we saw a ai picture and thought it looked neat. \n\n# Shitty anti experiences. \n\nLets face it, most \"selfless artists\" absolutely come from a place where \"selflessness\" more or less means taking things away from others to make themeselves richer. In most other places we call that monopolistic greed. \n\nIn artist's minds, Their \"selfless\" ideas include forcing and taking options away from people. They have hate fantasies about stomping on the people who for years supported them, having the nerve to talk about \"being stabbed in the back\" when im pretty sure they were the ones who started screaming slurs and obscenities FIRST for merely viewing a picture from our povs.\n\nThere's a difference in liking a PICTURE, KAREN and fucking yelling slurs at people FOR LIKING THEM..\n\nYet for all they complain, the average national minimum wage is 2x higher than anything i HAD to live through to support them. \n\nThey're complaining about making 2x the pay PER HOUR. Like damn man! For all those years, did you think we were just all walking wallets that materialized money out of thin air to feed them with?? \n\n# (The problem with antis ) \nTBH many of the 90%+ of the vocal speaking anti minorities come off as super extreme, completely self centered selfish \"selfless\" people.\n\n(How often do they talk about money, but neither of them puts money to mouth, and get a 80k-120k $ job to support 8-11 of their peers? Almost none of these artists support another financially. Commissioners DO.) \n\nBut they'll be damn sure to tell you about how morally superior they are to you, (for doing nothing that requires lifting up a finger or doing any hard labor past being angry on twitter. \n\n# (Ai's just really fun and honestly freeing to use for mental creativity/infinite variety!) \n\nWhat if i want to draw winter wolves. But my artstyle is stuck in a inkwell horror style. People might rave about my skeletons, my undead creatures. But if we want wolves, or polar bears, or cute, or risque, My inky horror style is about 110% completely incompatable with furry/fluffy things. And it might be completely unsuited for the stories i want to make and keep changing. \n\nSure they may say they love the haunting dripping way my inkwell style lends itself well to the macabre. But unless im doing a horror campaign, they'd probably get bored of it. Plus it's not labor efficient to produce and a campaign with only 1-4 skull creatures could get boring over years of time or for me very easily. \n\n# (Even if develop a artstyle over 2-4+ years. What if YOU GET bored of it?) \nSure i can draw creepy undead, horror monsters, Shining metalic ink swords and blades. And that's fun and all. But what if i get bored of their own style? You people are the ones who see it for 2s in 4 years.\n\nBut if im the one who wants something new, im the one who has to spend 2-4 years to develop a new personal art style if i wanted to please some crybaby on twitter crying about obsoletion and how everyone should handicap themselves to devote their lives to a unemployed cryer.\n\n And if i want spontaneously for a rp, bye. Or work/life balance on TOP of a 60-70 hr cram week... BYE\n\nI'm not throwing my life away for a 14 year old having a crybaby tantrum on twitter. (We've already seen people who entertain their outbursts see their last week's goalposts instantly move away in the next 10 minutes). \n\nI don't plan to ever monetize my work, i have a dayjob that'd pay me 40-200x more than anything trying to sell my work would be. So why can't i just create things i love to devour and have my boring job pay the bills? I have highly valuable skills in the work industry. But everyone knows being creative is fun. \n\nI do writing/worldbuilding to escape life, express myself, have fun, and share the worlds trapped in my mind with others. Not to put myself in a self chosen pit where my family is starving so i can be a self centered ass to please shit-for-brains crybabies. \n\n(Who seem to have nothing better to do than gatekeep fun, while circlejerking and announcing they're unemployed on twitter)\n\n# (Hmm. Tl;dr)\n\n**I love the joy of creation and world building. Ai offers me a way to keep my players entertained, offer characters for those who cannot afford them, and flesh out worlds.** \n\n*Taking ai away just feels like selfish gatekeeping by the people i supposedly \"selfishly\" paid to support for years.

With the rise of this practice, lots of translators lost their jobs, or saw their payments plummet because the person who normally hired them knew they could get a half-assed translation for free from Google and are only hiring them to \"clean it up\" or do a more thorough, elegant job.  A real translator will tell you it's not that easy or simple, you generally have to translate text from the ground up, you can't just sit there and try to make sense of what Google spat out.

But the **spender's quality of life, almost seems like a afterthought.** People seem to assume the money poofs out of nowhere, that you don't see people assumed rich, turn out to be middle wage workers going into debt to buy a 2000$ piece and then canceling it due to debt. Sometimes the whales of the gaming industry have spending disorders. You expect rich people but you get people with gambling addictions spending money meant to feed their families or impulse buying stuff.\n\nThe idea of watching spenders work 3 jobs and then insulting them if they run out as the \"poors who don't deserve anything\" kinda seems paradoxial. I Went back and watched people socially shame a person into buying artworks after ai. The person was going into debt and had already spent 1000$s over 20x 50$-100$ pieces. They had already given 1000$s. But their income was mcdonalds. For the anti ai people, it was seen as a \"pro artist\" movement. For me as a observer. it seems like they bullied a person who was trying to feed their kids, working 3 jobs. into going to **credit card debt to appease a mob that cyberharassed them as a 'feels good story'??**\n\n**It seems like the only purpose of a giver to a taker is to be just that. A wallet who's job is to throw 1000$s at them.** \n> But the moment they run out, be discarded and thrown away. The wallet's qol is a afterthought. Whether or not the wallet is feeding their kids is a afterthought. You're just nothing but a walking moneybag who's purpose is to praise them, and while it's probably not intentionally malicious. It does seem like a raw deal for the other person. Spend, SPEND, SPEND.. But if you run out. Fuck you, goodbye, can kinda be one sided, ain't it? \n\n# (Black mirror: What if money could be cloned, without harming the original?) \nIf there was a **black mirror** version of ai **where artists were able to press a button. And copy any working's man's bank account without harming the original.** Do you really think there'd be like as much drama if people could press a button, and copy all the money you worked for? Like copying all the 100,000$s in a bank account. \n\n**You can bet your ass we'd probably be pissed but we wouldn't be going.**\n\n> \"I WORKED HARD FOR MY MONEY, now they have a copy of my money, but all my money is intact! MONEY CLONING IS THEFT! WE NEED TO KILL MONEY COPIERS FOR MAKING A COPY OF OUR MONEY!!!\" (Even though our ability to make money, keep money, and all our current money would still be there.)\n\n> (Disclaimer: *Assume no obvious effects of inflation. All goods have the same value. Both people can now buy whatever you want. Hell, assume you could even CLONE your own bank account balance and have infinite money to spend. A perfect copy is made without harming the original. It'd be far from fair, but it wouldn't be life or death. Just excess that made you feel like your time was wasted to freeloaders. But you could still continue with the original.)*\n\n**Most people would probably be pissed off and annoyed, but probably not militant about it.** \n> \"Hey, what the hell, i worked hard over all those years doing shitty jobs and working and slaving away for hours, and now artists just press a button and get a copy of all my money for free. without NEEDING to do anything? Well ain't this a raw fucking deal. How come i do all the work, they do all the SLACKING, and we both end up with them COPYING my money! Getting all 100% of the fruits, for 10% of the work! This is some bullshit 'ere!\" \n\n# And isn't ai, for better or worse. \n\nMore just like **unlimited free competition from hell**. Vs unlimited free products for a consumer pov? \n\n**One pov is free choice** from heaven, the other pov is **unlimited free competition from hell.** But the free choice can also imitate anything you do or make whatever the person wants. Kinda crazy ain't it? A real world technology that almost defies even what sci fi could have dreamed of. \n\nAnd now *\"the problem TM\"* is, it's too good, too fast, too accessible, \"too free\". And anyone with a 4-8 gb gpu can have it. \n\n# Tl;dr\n\n**Everyone wants to be famous. But who wants to be THE WALLET, used, spent, and thrown away when you run out??**", "486": "Hahahahaha.

This is only ever a thing done by people literally learning to draw (in the first week or month of learning) or by animators creating a rotoscope animation (even then, rotoscoping almost always involves embellishments beyond the traced work).\n\nThe fact is artists do not trace as a standard practice, individuals might do an element here and there, but the majority use referencing and train their eye. \n\nBest way to do this is the grid method (put a set of grid lines on top of your source, then try to draw each square from the source on a blank canvas next to the source.\n\nThis process trains an eye for detail, spatial placement, anatomy and form (among other things).\n\nI\u2019m all for AI in assisting the production of art, but it\u2019s important to clarify what is current standard practice.", "520": "Huh? Tracing and copying is really frowned upon in the art community. Only really appropriate for use in anatomy references.\n\n\nReferencing art and tutorials might be what you mean. For when you look up art you like and enjoy and put effort into (mostly trying and failing) to implement aspects of it into your own art. This is how artists find their art styles- but times it by like a kajillion.\n\nBut even then, this isn't recommended.  Like how only drawing anime isn't recommended. You're basically copying styled art- without an understanding of the basics. Eventually,  the artist will not improve unless they study and, therefore, won't get better.", "521": "Same. I can often tell pretty easily, which also makes me laugh when people go after artists accusing them of AI when I can tell there\u2019s absolutely no way it was AI.

I think it's important to not forget why people are upset and have compassion for them. \n\nThat said, it's not going away and artists need to make peace with that.

Most people in today's online art community will agree that \"referencing is good and tracing is icky\", but different people mean different things by tracing. It's plain to see when you read in-depth discussions on it (which are rare, because usually you taught about referencing in the art school, offline). What some people consider referencing, others would consider tracing. Some would say \"referencing is when you look at a photo for a pose and shadows\", others would call copying a creative solution from another artwork referencing. Some would even use mechanical methods to do this and not just their hands.\n\nOutside of the today's online art community, even referencing may be frowned upon. There's enough debunks even in today's internet that reminds \"Referencing is okay actually! Artists reference!\"--because it still needs to be reminded. Depictions of artists in media don't depict them referencing. It's not open information to those outside of the art community.\n\nAnd commercial art is another story altogether. Are there rules of what you're allowed to do when making a living with art? No, except copyright, there are not. You do whatever puts food on the table faster.

Does that make me a theif? \n\nThe data collected from images by SD is so extremely broken down and \u201cdiffused\u201d that it\u2019s impossible to exactly copy anything. The only examples of supposedly copied work I\u2019ve seen are from artists deliberately using their art as the singular \u201cinput image\u201d that most AI image generators are capable of very heavily basing its final image on.

And intention comes from the prompt. Give me an idea for an image and my brain will start flipping through iterations of various ideas in my head. Eventually I settle on one and flesh it out but that idea, that image in my head, that\u2019s the part that AI assists with. Of course it doesn\u2019t have intention, but, if I\u2019m using it for ideas or even elements of something I\u2019m working on, I am the one with the artistic and creative intentions. \n\nLet me put it another way\u2026 Intention is the soul of art.

Someone who commissions a work of art would never consider themselves the artist. Someone who comes up with a creative prompt for r/writingprompts wouldn't consider themselves the author of what people write based on that prompt. \n\nBut if you use AI for an inspiration and then create a wholly separate piece of art, then that's something totally different. \n\nI totally agree that AI operates very similarly to the human brain. It can automatically produce artistic representations based on its knowledge base. I think it's the \"automatic\" that separates it from what the brain is capable of.

However so are a lot of the \u201cartists\u201d I see making traditional \u201cart.\u201d And I\u2019ve seen prompt jockeys who consistently produce better images and spend more time refining and discerning between aesthetics of different outputs than other AI users.

Look around you, we have \u201cmodern\u201d artists who thrive by paint some scribble or paint blob that costed millions of dollars (and it's probably scheme for money laundering).\n\nI dont think these 'modern' artists should be used as an example bc they are the smallest minority in the community and like you said, money laundering for rich people.\n\n>Even small artists are no different, look at what's popular art on social media, nobody's making that unique and creative work anymore, it's either fan art of popular trends/shows/anime or erotic works. Because they need that sweet clout engagement to thrive in this modern internet age. There's no way for the \u201creal\u201d artist who made great creative contents can keep up with today's age of art industrialization.\n\nIn what way is it a problem? Fanart has always existed and is a core part of art. You could say that michaelangelo, Goya etc. engaged in fanart,  a great portion of their most influental art was basically fanart of the Bibel or Homers works. Saying that its not original in any way denies the use of their own style or own interpretation. And even if they try to copy a frame of their favourite TV show, its always gonna be art. Not only bc a human brain cant/doesnt want to fully copy it, but also bc they engaged in the process and you improve as an artist  through studys and copying. I would even go as far as say that all good art has somewhat an influence by fanart.\n\n>My only disagreement with his take is that he believe that by keep protesting against A.I. art companies and call for regulations for a.i art, it will hinder the development of a.i art. Which is far from possible.\n\nCompanies and rich people dont care about what the poor creators and poor consumers think. I feel like many Ai bros act like a circle jerk , fighting for the development in the Creative industry while not wanting to understand why its problematic to just let AI be trained on everything it can find. I actually find it kinda childish/thoughtless of how pro AI people throw around phrases like \"technological evolution\" or \"luddites\" while not understanding the core problems. \"Because technological evolution is always morally right and if you dont get hard by the thought of 'democratizing skills' and making everybody lazy consumers, get fucked as an luddite artist\" Hope you dont misunderstand that as an insult.\n\n>Like writing a good story with your art, make video games with your art, as nowadays making game is easier than ever with the abundant resources to learn it (you can even ask a.i to write game code for you), or start making original contents on social media a form a community from it.\n\nAs fast as AI is currently developing i think its realistic to say that in 15 - 20 years, almost all creative jobs wont be needed for companies. And oneday there wont even be needed a single creative person bc AI will be able to analyze data of what people enjoy and consume and therefore create something that looks somwhat original. Should we really be striving for a future where everything gets automated except the things that (disabled) people would actually need to get automated that would improve their life?\n\nDont get me wrong, I think AI as a tool is a great achievment and especially would be great for artists in the animation industry. But i dont think people who dont give a shit about artists like the midjourney creators should get to decide how the creative industry woll evolve.", "770": "I just find i a bit condesending that an subreddit about defending ai art dosent allow discusion.

What I mean is today's artists are creatively bankrupt thanks to art industrialization, a problem that stem deep before the existence of a.i art.\n\nImagine you are a great artist who can draw anything you desire, and one day you want to create some original high quality work, but then you realize that you don't get proper recognition for your work because realized that in order to get that, you have to create works on popular trends that are most likely just low quality works (like erotic anime, viral shows/trends, etc.). So you follow the herd to get recognition. \n\nAnd finally you realized that following the herds is much more sustainable than creating original high quality work, so you just keep doing that. You may be creative in a technical sense, but in essence you're creatively bankrupt thanks to art in industrialization. (You should definitely watch that video I sent you about art industrialization and how a.i. art is not the main issue)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have no problem if you just want to draw, your favourite shows or popular trends for fun or as motivation for you to improve your craft. But, if you're able to create original works or high quality works, but decided to be a part of a problem in art industrialization. Then you're no different from A.I. prompters who made some creatively bankrupt or low quality contents (albeit your works may be a human art, but it's still creatively bankrupt).\n\nI have more respect to those who may not have good technical skill, but still trying to create high quality works than highly skilled artists that just spewed low quality works that contribute to art industrialization. \n\nTechnical mastery of a craft does not constitute creativity and creativity doesn't always come from just technical mastery of a craft.", "772": "We have made a sub specifically for debate on AI.

Belief that you are the majority opinion even when you aren't.\n2. Belief that your opinion is \"obvious\" to anyone and \"objectively true.\" I find that people who work with art exclusively are particularly susceptible to this because they tend to develop the habit of talking about subjective things as though they are objective. I've noticed that \"objectively,\" has become the new \"literally.\"\n3. Belief that anyone who disagrees with you has been brainwashed or indoctrinated against their better judgement in some way.  The term \"sheeple\" has become a joke, but it's been replaced with various versions of \"-bro.\" Using the term is basically a version of covering your ears and singing \"lalalala!,\" because it indicates that you have no interest in engaging with anything that the \"poor brainwashed fool\" has to say.  There's a certain irony is this one.\n4. Connected to that is the belief in low-level conspiracy theories. There's often (but not always) some big, moneyed organization or group of wealthy individuals that has brainwashed the \"sheeple\" with hollow promises. e.g., the \"fools\" that are doing the \"normalizing\" above. (edit: Ironically, there is some big money involved, but it's what's pushing for regulation as a form of regulatory capture, and they're happy to rouse the artists to help with their dirty work.)\n5. The tendency to immediately dismiss and refuse to deal with any physical, scientific, quantitative, or technical facts that prove that your opinion is physically or mathematically impossible. (e.g. the AI is just copy pasting from the terabytes of images that it \"ingested\" and is somehow storing in it's 1-2 gigabyte model.)\n\nEdit: went to the comment section, sorted by new, and scrolled down. There are negative comments, but the vast majority of the really negative ones seem to be in the last 24 hrs or so. Sure looks like classic brigading.\n\nEdit: There's a 6\n\n6. Tendency to lump people you disagree with you on different topics into one, monolithic  \"flock of sheeple.\" Is this case, you get the idea that \"the tech-bros couldn't sell us on crypto, so now they're doing the AI art thing.\" While there's some overlap in the people interested in the two (just like any two things), there's no indication that people working in crypto moved over into AI. The people developing crypto applications are still largely developing crypto applications; it's just that they're largely enterprise-based so you don't hear about them as much.

They're trying to say it's not \"art\" in the same category as the visual ones manually made.\n\nIt's true, AI art is not that kind of art and is not in the same category. But it's not a bad thing.

One thing I find with AI art is that it has absolutely no contextual knowledge of eg how machines work, or how stable structures are constructed, or how trees naturally grow etc. It\u2019ll, say, make a machine with a ton of wires but they\u2019ll make no sense functionally.\n\n(Same with ChatGPT.

I've learned quite a bit of Photoshop techniques, how to blend images together, etc.  I think AI Art is more a technical skill than an art.\n\nIn just the two months I've done this, I can already look back at some of my first creations and think \"Man, that piece sucks, if I were to make it now, I would do X, Y, Z...\"", "844": "I believe there is a considerable amount of people who are pro AI art, but simply silent about it.

I completely understand anti-AI sentiment, I think it\u2019s a mistake to totally dismiss those who have concerns around removing humans from art.\n\nAgree. I mean, the end goal of this technology is \u2013 at the very least \u2013 to make artists **optional** in the process of art creation *(or the process of commercial art creation if one wants to be more precise)*. And what I mean by that? This technology in its most powerful form *(and we will get there, it's just a matter of how long)* would be able to: understand nuances, understand social rules, would be able to read between the lines, would master human anatomy, would really really really nail what you are going for. It would be able to create whole comic books, whole books, it would be able to create movies eventually. Everything as good as the best movie directors could make it.\n\nAnd I honestly find this freaking awesome, cause most art folks would want to see simply can't be produced, financially  \u2013 especially more pricy things, such as TV shows and movies, which cost millions of dollars. And this technology essentially free art creation from an economic aspect. **Any art anyone would enjoy seeing will exist, and it will exist in the best most amazing version of itself.** And those who want to use it as a tool can use it as a tool, it will be the most powerful tool ever made, **a tool that can be as good as one wants it to be.**\n\nAnd this, ironically enough, it is precise the problem for people making a living creating commercial art. It is a tool so good it can work well enough without the artist.\n\nI watched Steven Zapata's video, Zapata is probably the poster child of the anti-AI movement, I disagreed with everything he said with the exception of one: \u201cThis technology is *(will be)* a replacement\u201d. At least of artists who are doing art for other people and getting paid to execute the creative vision of someone else. AI art will get better and better, until it is able to do everything by itself or just following the directions of the manager.... until the manager also gets his job automated away, and the manager manager and so on and so far.\n\nI truly believe AI will be able to do anything humans are able to do \u2013 not only in art, but in general, Artificial General Intelligence is not only possible but it is most likely inevitable at this point. Unlike Zapata, I don't think this is a bad thing or that society should fight it against, but probably society will have to implement some sort of UBI eventually. Although, artists are like 2% of the workforce, so politicians will probably won't do it just for them.\n\nAnyway, sorry for my long text. As I said on other posts, the only actual problem that artists have with this technology is with how it impacts their livelihoods, which is ultimately an economic/social issue rather than the technology itself. Cause, as I said above, for those wanting to learn how to draw or to paint, the machine can't give you the skill, the machine can't teach how to paint, if one wants to learn the experience of how to paint, they will still have to learn it .", "853": "Conspiracy time but I suspect a lot of underperforming and insecure artists are just riding the algorithm wave for more engagement.

Thats the art. If we have no goal we can spit out great images at random but whether or not that's exactly what we wanted to make down to the details is another thing entirely.", "858": "It\u2019s a very understandable position to take. As humans, we naturally crave beautiful things and will be drawn to sources of it.\n\nThere\u2019s a few dangers here though:\n\n1. Overconsumption can lead do desensitisation. We lose what truly inspires us in art if we can consume a hundred variations of an awe inspiring landscape per day. I remember as a kid being fascinated by a select dozen or so images in some sci fi books or encyclopaedias we owned. These days I could create a thousand images even more incredible in an afternoon. But it just doesn\u2019t feel the same.\n\n2. Overlooking the importance of the creative process - it\u2019s easy as consumers of art to fall into the trap of thinking that art is only about the end product. But it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s the communities that spring up, supporting, advising. The industries that support workers, the emotional support it can give to creators who find a large audience to share their work with. I see people saying \u201cwell your art is bad, AI should replace you\u201d which is a terrible and cruel point of view. Almost all great artists will have made bad art for most of their careers, and so what if people make bad art? They\u2019re still creating, reaching out to peers, learning life skills.\n\n3. AI art will trend towards the mundane and the mass appeal. Risk takers won\u2019t be creating interesting new works, as they know it\u2019ll just become part of the models in a months time. We\u2019ve got more than enough video/movie content even now, I can\u2019t imagine how bland a world would be in which everyone consumed only their own fairly tedious generic content, no one would discuss art any more, it would become simply part of the daily grind\n\nIn short yeah, AI makes incredible things, and lots of it, but having that unlimited choice isn\u2019t always great for community cohesion.\n\nedit: also the UBI point is a very important one, but sadly I believe that history has shown us this won\u2019t be the case. It will only lead to more people having to work unhappy low paid jobs, or survive on extremely limited support. A far cry from the automated utopia we\u2019d all rather be living in!", "859": "I think you're kind of right. I don't like saying this because I do respect what everyone does, but, art can be judged on its quality.\n\nThere are good artists who are upset for whatever reason too, I won't deny that, but it does seem like the loudest are, honestly, not very good artists. Being a popular artist on reddit or YouTube is not the same as being an actual good artist and so much of their art has technical skill but is otherwise derivative and empty. The Sam Does Arts guy, he's just honestly not a very good artist. Which is maybe why he's popular on the internet among other amateur artists but that's really it.\n\nAnd I get it, technical skill but derivative is honestly a valuable niche, and that is definitely going to be what AI really impacts first. So I see why they're upset, obviously I disagree but I think we all know what's up with that already.", "860": "I don't think that the overconsumption itself is that much of a problem, I mean... \n\nIn the end of the day, I always think having **more art** in this word is better than having less art. If I have to choose to live in a word where there are only 100.000 books available or a world where there 100.000.000.000.000 books available, I would always choose the second one \u2013 always. Cause the other art, the other things, that don't interested me, I don't need to look at it. I always have the personal choice to not \u201coverconsume\u201d. But if that art didn't exist... **I'm denying all the wonder and joy that such things could bring to someone else, to other people**. Also, even if that were a problem, I don't even think it would be thaaaaatt much of a bigger problem because of AI art, like nowadays there are already more books, more music, more movies that anyone could watch in their entire lives.\n\nAbout the creative process and the end product... I mean, only artists themselves experience the **\u201cjourney\u201d*, it is something too individual and personal.* What the rest of us see is a product, a result. A movie, an image, a book, whatever it is. And the public reacts to that art somehow, and it touches them in a way or the other, I think art is also about the public, how will they react to it? Not surprisingly, you oftentimes have pieces of art where the public reaction and interpretation of that giving piece of art totally differs from what the author had in mind. But ultimately, I think art is about itself. I believe once an art is created, it gets a life of its own, it becomes greater than the artist.\n\nIt doesn't mean I think there won't be an admiration for those who master a skill. I think we can compare the situation with chess players and chess engines. The current engines can beat the world champion in a blink of an eye. Humans haven't been able to compete with machine for more than 20 years at this point, since Deep Blue won from Kasparov back in 1997. People still value a **human knowing how to play chess masterfully**. And I think it's the same with art creation, there will be a group of people who value someone doing the things, the skill.\n\nAbout the mundane and the mass appeal...I fail to see how is this any different from the world where we live right now. There are already  way too many generic Marvel movies. What we should do **burn art to reduce mass appeal and mundaneness?** Also, who decides what is mundane and mass appeal? I hate Marvel movies as much as the next guy, but I prefer to live in a world where they exist than live in a world where they don't, cause I simply always have the choice to not watch them. Also if the cost of creating art was cheaper there would be waaaaay more not-mundane and not-mass appeal art for those who are interested, because you could create things without needing to worry about *\"Oh, how much will this cost?\"*.\n\nMaybe there are 5.000 people in the world who would want to see a japanese anime with the late 80s anime style animation about a japanese pirate from the Meiji Period who travels in time to 1960s Japan and decide to become a fisherman, and the pirate end up attending that famous Beatles show in Japan in 1966 in the end of the anime's finale. Would any studio throw millions of dollars to make this anime? Pretty sure they wouldn't. But if we had AI that anime could exist for those who want to see it. At the end of the day **who are we to deny or decide what art should exist in this world to other people to see?** \n\nAlso, it is worth to highlight that that there other things that motivate people other than becoming famous or rich or powerful. Risk takers will take risks, they speak their mind. Regardless of thinking *\"Someone will \u201ccopy\u201d my work. So what? I won't stop expressing myself just because of that\"*. If you love painting or drawing... I don't see why anyone would stop painting just because there is a machine that can do it \"better\" than them. Same way people still learn how to play chess these days even though an engine can play better than them.\n\nAbout UBI, I think they will be sort of force do that honestly. Because even the \"low paid jobs\", those **will also be automated away** as well. I saw many artists reacting like *\"oh, this is something against us, personally\"*, and it honestly isn't. I'm sure there is someone else working right now on automate other jobs like supermarket cashiers and garbage disposal and others as soon as possible. And the way the market works... companies are sorta forced into automation. Because if they don't automate, their competitor automate first and put them out of business. In other words, everybody will have their jobs automated, sooner or later. Like, to give a simple example, I'm sure if the record labels had their way, they would still be selling CDs for $20 or so. This whole thing reminds me this image showing all the devices the smartphone replaced:\n\n put it simply, our whole economic system, I deeply believe, will change drastically in the next decades, and I don't think most people have a good grasp what is about to come and how will this affect us all. Also, humanity has been getting better, there is a great book called \"The Good Angels of Our Nature\", which talks about how violence, murder and violence and all those bad things have been decreasing throughout the centuries.  Thing about it: not even the richest man from the middle ages would have been able to buy an antibiotic that would save his daughter's life. Nowadays they are widely available in large chunks of the word, except for the poorest nations. Is it all perfect? Hell no, but it is way better. In most aspects a person living a middle ages would describe the quality of life in many countries around the world today as \u2013 I wouldn't say utopia, cause it has sort fairy tail-ish vibes \u2013 but definitely as **pretty goddammit good**.", "861": "On point 3 I disagree. On the one hand yes, things will become more desensitized, but we have already been going this way with our current tools as is. Just look at films, games, art and the content you see today on Youtube. The bottom line always aims toward a generalized audience which at it's core, is super bland and always will be (But also makes the most income/money).   \n\n\nIf everyone can create whatever they imagine, it means more opportunity for unuique ideas to develop into niche fandoms. Because the level of production is easier and faster for an individual it means that cool story some animator made that you love can actually be completed into a full on series for you to enjoy, with no risk of dying out because of typical corporate or money based behavior.   \n\n\nWe can go back to enjoying something for the sake of it and not be limited by how successful it is to the general audience. Personally, I usually hate what the general audiences like so having the option to consume something wholly unuique that can actually be a complete story is far more appealing.", "862": "Good points, I do hope things go in that direction.

I mean in regards to procedurally generated worlds, like Minecraft for instance. Rather than a world being generated by seed, only some elements are, and at a certain distance. Other elements come in based on a premise of actually storytelling. Say you like Necromancy, Fishing, Exploring, and Revenge stories. The game spawns you in a small town, generating a world akin to Minecraft. The AI already has some idea of what you like, so this town has a river, you do a brief bit of fishing and a rivalry forms with a local fisherman. The game responds dynamically. His wife gets kidnapped, and you offer to help. You fight the bad guy, who has connections to some mysterious cult, but the wife is already dead. You deliver the news, the fisherman is distraught. You are about to leave town, but you get word that the rival fisherman has fled town, and his wife\u2019s body has gone missing from her grave. But there is no quest marker, no follow up telling you where to go next, the world hasn\u2019t generated it yet, the map is being filled and drawn by you as you discover it, and as the AI builds it. \n\nYou head down the road, fighting enemies that scale with you, but are chosen based on your world so far, what you\u2019ve encountered, and what you will encounter. Maybe the path follows the river and you fight some gillmen, and you happen upon some Zombies harassing a carriage of people, and you save them and they tell you some Necromancers have taken residence in the next town. You end up investigating the Necromancers, and find their lair, only to run into the fisherman and his wife\u2019s body. I remind you, this was all procedurally generated, but based on an AI that understands elements of storytelling. What Chekhov\u2019s Guns are, and how to set up a twist. The big twist comes when it turns out that the Necromancers are the very cult that the original baddy worked for, and the fisherman delivered his wife to them hoping they would bring her back. But he had no idea that the Lich he was handing his wife over to was the very same man that killed her, now undead after being killed by your hand. \n\nYou are then given the opportunity to help the fisherman with his decision, to resurrect his wife, or get revenge on the one who killed her\u2026 a compelling choice for someone who enjoys both necromancy and revenge stories. Maybe the game allows you to simply type your words, you agree to let bygones be bygones and even aid the Lich if he can actually restore the fisherman\u2019s wife to the woman she once was, undo the wrongs that were wrought. The AI then gets to make a decision, does the Lich seek revenge on YOU, or does it give you the opportunity to learn Necromancy from the Lich in exchange for the agreement and the work you would do for it? Perhaps the Lich uses you and rewards you with the first few lessons in Necromancy, only to enact its revenge later when you have exhausted your usefulness, and before you may become powerful enough to become a thorn in its side. \n\nThink of it like AI Dungeon, but like it\u2019s actually generating a world just beyond the horizon as you travel. L4D2 is clever in that it delivers waves of zombies based on elements like progress, ammo, health and skill level, but that is small beans.

My Ikea chair is worth $50, but my handcrafted wooden chair was close to $600, which I happily paid because it was built especially for me. The issue, as I see it, isn't that AI displaces luxury goods, it's that it displaces non-luxury goods that have been existing in the luxury space.

There was a big contract for that one, and very clear expectations, and while they delivered a bit late, it was still a really fantastic piece. We plastered that sucker everywhere. *Everywhere*. We had so many compliments, and I was recommending the artist to anyone who asked. And then one person wrote to me and asked if \\[famous actor\\] was really involved in the project. \n\nRecord scratch, I tell you. I did some digging, and lo and behold, the artist had made the main character in this artwork almost a direct copy of a photo of an up-and-coming actor. They'd clearly painted it themselves, but it was probably traced at origin. It was a legal grenade with the pin pulled, and so we *frantically* rushed to pull it from circulation before anyone noticed. The artist, when confronted, was unapologetic. We might've sued and won damages for breach of contract, but they were just a solo freelancer, and it wasn't worth the bother.\n\nBut oh, let me tell you. After that experience, I always add to my commission requests: \"cannot resemble a real person, living or dead.\"\n\nWhich, to bring it back to SD, I am always *vaguely* terrified that the AI will accidentally reproduce a celebrity without direct prompting.

The Rock, Paper, Scissors short that he hates so much will have more cultural impact than any of his works.\n\nAnd for the record, I think most AI art that's just prompts of popular characters and franchises is garbage.

The artists in this case are more like technicians than creators, people who perform a job and are hired to create a product regardless of its intent and meaning. Much like Palmer, they don't seek to offer anything new or important to the world, and they don't advance culture by doing this work. This isn't a bad thing, of course. In this world, everyone has to work to live, but the point of me saying all this is that RJ Palmer's opinion is worthless, and he has no credentials in the art world to speak of what's art and what isn't. He's a hired gun for corporate interests, and that's been the majority of his career. He has nothing to say, but he pretends to be a fine artist. If he wasn't saying this stupid bullshit, I wouldn't be pointing out how meaningless his career is.\n2. Yes, I agree.

AI art generators are actually currently harder to predict for and control outcome, although I could see it becoming equal to the simplicity of smartphone photography soon.\n\nOn the other hand, artistry is so much more than that and involves abilities that are agnostic of medium, like vision, consistency, storytelling ability, and more. you have real artistry with photography for example where you can use a camera as one tool in a workflow that might include concept development & bring together multiple artists/creates, custom lighting, and custom post processing.", "1502": "I think it looked great, again I think, its subjective, and it got like 380 mil in the box office, so kinda cool.", "1503": "I\u2019d agree.

It reminds us that this kind of anti-truth or anti-beauty downvoting happens everywhere. It has Tamil origins. I am currently researching Tamil history, and getting the same response: if you talk about great discoveries then you are a Bad Person. \n\nLong version: \n\n\"Illegitimi non carborundum\" is mock-Latin for \"don't let the bastards grind you down. It is mock-Latin because \"um\" is usually a Latin suffix (meaning \"one\") but in this case it is not: carborundum is a trade name for silicon carbide used on grinding whels (hence \"grind you down\"). The word mixes \"carbon\" and \"corundum\". Corundum is an ancient Tamil word (in Sanskrit) for ruby-sapphire. The Tamils are the people of south-east India. They claim to one of the oldest peoples on Earth, tracing their poetic history to the lost continent of Mu, circa 50,000 BC. But the mainstream view is that Mu was invented as fiction in the late 1800s. I used to believe that. But lately I have been studying Tamil history. I am coming to the conclusion that they are right. But if you say that, you are accused of pseudo-science. You are first laughed at, because to most scholars Mu is transparently fake. Then you are acused of racism, because Mu was popular among those who think brown people cannot invent anything and therefore we all came from a lost white race (think Nazi swastikas, the ancient Indian symbol). I have a highly educated friend who is distressed that he thinks I am going down a white supremacist rabbit hole and he keeps emailing me about how I should not read anything by anyone who has ever been accused of racism. Which shuts down research. \n\nThis anti-Tamil brigading is crazy for a number of reasons. \n\n1. First, the Tamils are as brown skinned as any other indians, so are not not likely to promote a white racist origin story. \n2. Second, speaking personally, I have published a book arguing that the last ten thousand years of settled ariculture was a huge mistake. Even if I thought that ancient Tamils gave us civilisation (I do **not** think that), that would make them bad, not some kind of master race.\n3. Third, Hindu (and hence Tamil) mythology is cyclical. There is no concept of civilisation progressing over the long term. That is a Christian idea, not a Hindu one.\n4. Westerners attacking Tamil beliefs is classic racism: it assumes that these brown people are too primitive to understand their own history. That they are like children, believing any silly story that suits them. These same scholars say that the story of Mu as invented in the west: so they are accusing the Tamils of getting their mythology from white men.\n5. The facts (as far as I can see) support the Tamils: Mu was apparently real. Obviouly some of the 19th century assumptions about Mu have turned out to be wrong, but that is true for all science and all scholarship. E.g. it apparently referred to the large islands of Indonesia, Australiam, etc., which later colonised Polynesia, etc. The ancient texts are clear on that. It was not a single gigantic landmass in the middle of the Pacific, as the Victorians assumed, But that is a minor detail. Basically the Tamils were right, but if you say that then you get attacked as an idiot and a racist.\n\nFor anyone who is curious, here is the mythological evidence for Mu. This is totally off topic for AI art, so stop reading now! It is work in progress, so I am not in a position to defend it in detail. I plan to continue the research and write this up in detail for the next edition of my book in 2026. \n\n* The Greeks taught that the Ethiopeans originally came from India. (Ethiopia was the Greek word for all of black Africa, but this particular reference seems to refer to the region we now all Ethiopia: south of Egypt. It does not preclude other African groups, unknown to the Greeks, having a different origin.)\n* The Indians trace their civilisation to the first Manu, who survived a sudden catastrophic flood. A Manu is like an Adam, a first man, Except Hindu mythology is cyclical: each Manu is the survivor of the previous civilisation. Hindu civilisation runs in a Yuga cycles of 12,000 divine years. There is some disagreement over what that means, but as far as I can see, the most likely meaning is that these are normal calendar years. I think the number is just an observation, like saying \"people tends to live 70 years\". Sometimes it is more, often it is less. The Egyptian records (of Manetho) suggest that the average cycle is ten thousand years. So seven Manus ago suggests roughly 70,000 years ago.\n* Our oldest records (so the Yazidis claim) are the Yazidi records. Thye record a disaster around 70,000 BC. They describe it as a beautiful pearl (the previous world) breaking into four parts.  \n* The Hindu records describe the first flood as involving the seven great islands (usually taken to mean the Malay islands: Sumatra etc.) and involved help from intelligent ape-like humans who live in the forest.\n* The Tamil records tell of three periods when they tried to rescue civilisation by collecting their poetic history. Each period, a Sangam (gathering) lasted several thousand years. The last one corresponds to the writing of the current Hindu scriptues (circa 1500 BC to AD 500). Previous civilisations ended in catastrophic flooding: they refer to lands beyond south east India that are now underwater. \n* Tamils scholars estimate that their language began around 50,000 BC. This is based on how slowly language families diverge. it is a very rough number, and could easily be ten thousand years either way.\n* Mythology from Pacific islands and Americas suggest their ancestors came by boat from a western direction. \n\nIn summary, the legends suggest a great flood in the Malay peninsula or islands, around 50-70,000 years ago (a very rough number). At that time there were still other non-homo sapient hominids (the intelligent ape men). After the catastrophe, our ancestors (homo sapiens) spread around the world. The second great Sangam flood probably refers to the rapid pulse of sea level rise after Younger Dryas, circa 9,000 BC. These floods destroyed the previous records.\n\nWhat does science say? \n\n* It is clear that the very oldest hominids (e.g. 1 million years ago) came from Africa. But they then spread to south east Asia. E.g. homo erectus in China, 700,000 BC. \n* If you track all the different kinds of hominid, the vast majority evolved in south east Asia. That is only logical, because the excellent climate plus separate islands encouraged pockets of evolution. \n* We know that homo sapiens were there by 50,000 BC at the very latest, because that is when we filled Australia. Unfortunately, the excellent climate of south east Asia means that human remains seldom survive. So scholars focus on the well preserved bones in Ethiopia. But lately they have found homo sapiens from the earliest times (beforw 100,000 BC)  in Morocco and Europe. So it looks like homo sapiens were everywhere, just like homo erectus. And as I said, most of the action probably took place in south east Asia.\n* The big change was circa 50,000 BC. Scientists call this the start of the upper paleolithic: when we became behaviourally modern. Thi is when we had art and music and religion and all the rest. This is when we spread rapidly around the world (Australia, etc.) This is when we had he bigest brains.\n* We also had a kind of writing. The highly scholarly book \"The First Signs\" had he details, The same 30 written symbols appear around the weorld from this point. This was not full writing, but a kind of memory aid. This would complement oral histories, so key facts were not forgotten.\n* The smoking gun is the Toba eruption in south east Asia around 71,000 BC. Causing massive tidal waves and global disruption, and possibly a genetic bottleneck (that part is controversial, and not needed for the theory).\n\nSo basically it all fits. Mythology says we came from large islands in south east Asia and dispersed after a great flood around 70,000 BC. Sceince confirms the details, but mainstream scholars still resist the evidence. If you point it out, you are called an idiot and a racist. \n\nIllegitimi non carborundum!", "1789": "Yes, I must admit there was a mistake on my part.

Which by the way, illustrates my approach, and the problems I have with most fringe theorists nd most mainstream scholars. I think they are both too quick to ignore (or not check) what ancient records say. I think we should start with what people say, as our foundation for history. In my opinion, too many fringe theorists start with very ambiguous evidence, like the positions of the pyramids, or some third-hand source, without any reference. And I think too many mainstream scholars are too quick to ignore parts of texts that they do not like. For example, the first Sangam (the Tamil meeting where they etablish their records) is recorded as taking 4,440 years. Schilars just dismiss that: it does not fit their theories so they just declare it to be wrong. I don't like that. Especially when the ancient numbers are confirmed by archaeology. Anyway, this is what Philostratus wrote.\n\nFrom Philostratus, \"The Life of Appolonius.\" For context, the great sage Appolonius is in India, and this is his conversation with an Indian sage. You will note from my user name that I am a big fan of Pythagoras. The Indian claimed that Pythagoras got his ideas from India. On a tangent, Appolonius is very much like Jesus, in teachings and miracles, and he suddenly appears in the ancient world just at the time and place where Jesus disappears. My fan fiction head canon is that they are the same person, until proven otherwise. But anyway, this is what the Indian said to Apolonius:\n\n \"O Apollonius, I would have you compare my own ancestor, or rather my ancestral body, for that was the light in which Pythagoras regarded Euphorbus. \"There was then,\" he said, \"a time when the Ethiopians, an Indian race, dwelt in this country, and when Ethiopia as yet was not; but Egypt stretched its borders beyond Meroe and the cataracts, and on the one side included in itself the fountains of the Nile, and on the other was only bounded by the mouths of the river. Well, at that time of which I speak, the Ethiopians lived here, and were subject to King Ganges, and the land was sufficient for their sustenance, and the gods watched over them; but when they slew this king, neither did the rest of the Indians regard them as pure, nor did the land permit them to remain upon it;\"\n\nNotice that he is talking about the poeple from the east coast of Africa, near Meroe. That is, near modern day Ethiopia. This does not mean that *every* African people is from Egypt, it is just about that group, Egypt's southern neighbours.\n\nAlso notice the size of Egypt. Traditionally we think of Egypt as just being the Nile, but for much of its history it included the Levant. E.g. in the Old Testament, until Necho famously lost his empire to Babylon, Egypt controlled Israel, Syria, etc. When we remember that Egypt was that entire region, and look at the continuity of culture, we see that the Egypt of the Pharaohs is simply the end point of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) people. As Philostratus said, their lands stretched from India to Ethiopia. This was when most people were nomadic, and made shrines here and there, such as famously at Gobekli Tepe (the northern end of the PPN territory. What I am saying is that these myths are not just stories. \n\nThe idea that Ethiopians came from India is dismissed by modern scholars as just confused orientalism (see Pierre Schneider, E. A. Schwanbeck, U. P. Arora and Klaus Karttunen). This drives me crazy. We dismiss ancient records as if they are made by childish idiots. but what is more childish or idiotic than for so-called historians to reject ancient records?", "1809": "Then I just copypaste my answer from the post:\n\n\"At first it was just an idea in my head.

Is this always the case? Some argue that using AI in this manner is unethical.\n\nI mean, it could have been the case with early text-to-image AI models when training datasets were openly available on the web. However, I believe that modern AI models are more cautious about their training datasets.", "1909": "It really depends on the model and what data it was trained on. The 'ethical' method is only training on data you own. Adobe trained a model using their stock image library which they have the legal right to use in any way because they own all the rights. Some people are still upset because they didn't agree to have their images used in Ai training, but they sold their rights to Adobe and don't have a leg to stand on.\n\nThe other more grey area is training using any data. This means that a model may be trained from movie stills, artwork posted online, and other copyrighted content. This is mainly why some people are saying it's 'stealing'. It's taking content that is not owned by the creator, and it learns what that content is by decomposing it into a neural net. The training images do not remain (unless there was a large bias in the dataset and it overfit to it). You can attempt to infer where the data came from, but with minimal success. In some cases artists were crying fowl, but their work wasn't even part of the training set.\n\nThere are a few issues with wanting to exclude copyrighted materials. First is that we don't live in a vacuum. People will wear copyrighted content on their clothing, have designer clothing and accessories, drive cars, use electronics, etc. Basically any product has some type of protections behind it. If you are training a model using your vacation photos and there's a coke billboard in the background, you're wearing a Mickey mouse T-shirt and holding a dior bag, you just feed the system copyrighted materials. \n\nThe next issue is transformation and fair use. Generally it's only to use other people's material if it's transfomitive. Sometimes it's a more direct usage like in a snl parody. Sometimes it's an indirect inspiration like in show The Orville. Either way, it's clearly not the original but obviously inspired by the original content.\n\nThis starts to lead into the next more philosophical problem of how we as humans learn and create content. As much and some would like to believe it, we don't just create things out of nothing. We learn things and watch things. We use our entire life as reference when making something new. We don't expect artists to not watch copyrighted content. Why would we expect that of something else that's learning? In fact another case of fair use is research and teaching. \n\nAnother issue is that any user can fine tune train a model with any data they have. A base model's initial training may be completely stripped of copyright, but then the user trains it with copyrighted content. You see this a lot when they want to train off their own content.\n\nTo summarize. While many companies are being cautious about their training data, not everyone is being transparent about their process and the end user can alter the models.", "1910": "It largely comes from a lack of understanding of how AI models work.\n\nMost AI art programs diffuse reference images into noise to learn what the colors/contours/etc for certain things are, and then when you give it a prompt to generate, say, an apple, it looks over the data to figure out what an \"apple\" looks like, what color it should be, etc. The actual image is created, it's not just cobbled together from pieces like people think.\n\nIt's very much transformative despite what anti-AI people believe. It reproduces no specific work. Nothing about it is theft.", "1911": "You must be new here.\n\nI remember when I was learning 3D modelling 20 years ago - my modelling skills were pretty good, but I was still struggling with materials and lighting.

That's probably a bit harsh (artists *should* fail dozens of times and produce generic crap before they produce a masterpiece, it's just part of the learning process), but that's exactly what it is. Artists have struggled with differentiation from mainstream trends and technology making things easier long before AI existed. When the modern incarnation of art supplies shops first came about and exploded in popularity in the 20th century, people were worried that regular people can get access to dyes and pigments you would have previously had to obtain from unique sources and mix yourself, thereby devaluing art. Then it happened again with digital tools like Photoshop.\n\nBut when newer technologies become available, the truly great artists learn to differentiate in new ways. 3D modelling and game development are a great example of this. Or they stuck to more difficult traditional techniques as a way to differentiate &mdash; since there will always be a societal demand (maybe not a capitalist demand, though) for physical medium and the visual styles they provide.\n\nThe bickering and elitism associated with people arguing the merits of different art mediums & techniques was always stupid, since each medium for art is impressive in its own way when wielded by a great artist. Those who react to these changes by wishing to punish and impose bans on new mediums, new styles, and new techniques should know that [1930s Germany agrees with them]( in having a very particular and narrow conception of what \"real art\" is.", "1930": "Yeah, infact everything is a copy of a copy, the originality comes by the circunstance of the creation, the effort in art comes the fact that you gotta shape the universe physical to make that art, not only itself the paper, gotta stay late put blood and tears, and itself love what you are doing, it will be a good art, objetivily speaking, but if we learn anything from that you may only be reconize after you die (to me more objetive truth, is if your work survives entropy, that is the objetive definition of art, is true no matter the planet you live, and will be reconized 3k years from now on (casulity for the win!))", "1931": "That's the reality of what will happen.

So that nobody is going to use it.\n\nYeah, that's gonna happen alright.", "1934": "Because it isn't about protecting art, it's about hurting people they don't like.\n\nAI is an excuse to enact the cruelty they have always wanted to. The only thing that hatred loves more than the actual hating is *justified* hating, and the dawn of AI was essentially its christmas. It doesn't matter that the artist in guilty or innocent, it matters that they are allowed to be as much of a raging asshole as they can possibly be, and people will cheer them on for it instead of scorn them.\n\nYou have proof you didn't use it? Doesn't matter, you look too similar, you are making it harder for them to spot the real fakes. You built it on your own content and nothing else? Doesn't matter, the fact that the program ever so much as gave a teary-eyed wave towards your harddrive is evidence that you want the death of art and should be burned at the stake for it. Just trying to keep up with other artists? Then you don't deserve the position, you are trying to invade a space where you were never welcome in the first place.\n\nThey would see the end of a thousand artists just on the mere speculation that one of them could potentially use the new tech, because as far as they are concerned it doesn't truly matter how many artists get hurt in the process. There's a sucker born every minute, so it's far more efficient just to remove as many as they can and make it easier for the 'real' artists to sell their craft.\n\nThe funny part is, no matter how successful they are, any Anti whose goal has been the preservation of artistry has done more damage to the craft than AI ever could.

What I generated required almost zero effort and looked better than anything I could have done myself.\n\nWhen something is so easily accessible no one will recognise it as hard work; because compared to traditional art, it's so much easier and only requires 1/5th of the time investment. AI art is absolutely real art but will never receive the same praise traditional artists get because of this. (at least for now) \n\nIt's sad because without the centuries and centuries of artwork before now, AI art wouldn't be possible. So to go ahead and discourage and belittle traditional artists is just a massive slap in the face. \n\nI won't lie, my bias definitely falls to the side of traditional artists just because I believe it's the more difficult road to travel down in order to fully express themselves, and in my eyes is more impressive. So seeing the above comment talking about telling them that their art isn't even as good as AI is disgusting. \n\nI agree that they shouldn't gloat about destroying ai art generation, they should just do whatever they want with their art to protect it and get on with their day.

Jonathan wasted no time in interrogating the man about his background.\n\n\"Franklin Pitch, at your service!\" Franklin croaked, extending his bony hand. \"I'm a researcher into the limits of human creativity, a pursuer of the most sublime and mind-bending ideas humanity can produce.\"\n\nIntrigued, Jonathan leaned in, eager to discuss any color tips from an expert in creativity. \"Franklin, my good sir, if you wouldn't mind entertaining a question about your esoteric field,\" he began, casting furtive glances around the table to ensure no one was eavesdropping. \"You see, my work as a painter demands the constant invention of new colors. I'm curious if you've ever encountered a shade previously unknown to mankind?\"\n\nFranklin's eyes lit up at the mention of his life's work. His eyes bored into Jonathan's, and when he spoke, he enunciated each word with the precision of a surgeon's knife. \"Mr. Briksh, are you prepared to witness the pinnacle of human creativity? The manifestation of a new color that surpasses the boundaries of what you currently understand as perception?\"\n\nJonathan was more than prepared; he was a fiend for color, a true connoisseur. \"Absolutely,\" he whispered.\n\nIt was a bizarre color revolution that Franklin Pitch brought to Jonathan's quaint studio a week later. The scientist unveiled a small jar, and the color inside was, in a word, indescribable. It twisted and writhed unnaturally, like the shadows cast by a forest canopy overhanging a field of hallucinogenic flowers. It was a color that slipped from one's grasp in an instant, defying memory itself.\n\n\"You hold in your hands a creation unlike any other, Jonathan,\" Franklin said, the excitement audible in his quivering voice. \"The product of the wildest recesses of the human mind. Take caution, however, for once you witness this new color, your mind may never be the same.\"\n\nJonathan was giddy, the excitement near unbearable. And so armed with his canvas and tools, he set forth to create a masterpiece incorporating the unearthly color. He toiled for hours, transforming his studio into a sanctuary for the color, its uncanny glow bathing his face.\n\nAs he stepped back to examine his creation, Jonathan's mind fractured under the cosmic horror of the abyss that stared back. The color was not simply a manifestation of human creativity, but also a gateway to a realm beyond his understanding. It had latched onto his mind, feeding on his sanity and distorting the lines of reality.\n\nDriven to a frenzy by the powerful and consuming experience, Jonathan furiously painted more and more canvases. The color seeped into the very walls of his studio, infesting the space and consuming his world, sucking him in as it grew ever more monstrous.\n\nEventually, only a marvelously terrifying void existed where the small town of Bellifact once was. The color had swallowed the confines of that tiny studio, leaving behind only desolation, proof that human creativity was truly limitless, and that even the imagination could unlock doors best left unopened.", "2019": "Honestly, the best way to find that out would be to try it for yourself.\n\nIn my experience though, ChatGPT isn't creative. What it *is* very good at is projecting an illusion of creativity.\n\nOne way of breaking this argument down is to ask what creativity really is. In my opinion, the most powerful and impactful art involves take a concept that most people might not fully recognize or understand, and expressing it via an artistic medium. The deep, aesthetic pleasure of art flows from the communication of ideas between artist and patron.\n\nTake Banksy as an example. Most of their early artwork was done using nothing but stencils and spray paint. What made them so popular, however, was that their art presented an \"edgy\" but approachable commentary on the cultural zeitgeist of the day. Regardless of your feelings about Banksy's skill as an artist, it's hard to deny that a mixture of creativity, hard work, and pure luck was what made them so successful.\n\nThe current generation of AI can't do any of this, in part because it lacks the semantic understanding of the concepts embedded in its model. The aspects of art that humans consider the most creative (and therefore valuable) represent a very specific, and often deeply personal projection of cultural ideas.\n\nWe're nowhere near emulating this using neutral networks. I personally think this will become increasingly evident as the novelty if AI image generators begins to wear off.", "2020": "> *Lacks intent....did a human make it (or use a tool like AI to make it)? Then it was made with intent.* \n\nIf you want to be entirely reductionist about it then yes, you could absolutely argue that every action is intentional. \n\nIf that's the case, though, there's no longer any distinction between, say, a child's doodle and a renaissance painting. Sure, you can always find someone who'll appreciate each in their own way, but again, we've lost the element of distinctiveness (which is what AI boosters are so keen to emphasise.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Subtlety...what does being hard to understand or stealthy have anything  to do with it? If the picture failed to convey your  theme, then that is a failure on the creator.* \n\nSubtlety in art doesn't mean being stealthy. It means communicating shades of meaning that might normally get lost in the cultural milieu. \n\nEveryone has the capacity to appreciate subtlety (even if it's not necessarily to their taste.) The challenge for the artist is in penetrating the loud, primary colours of most cultural messaging in a way that can be enjoyed and understood. \n\n \n\n>Originality that is easy. Did it  exist before it was created? If not, then it is original. And AI does  this natively due to the random seed and rounding errors in the  hardware.\n\nAgain, reducing originality to its dictionary definition strips away any kind of distinction. By your logic, the latent noise used to seed a diffusion model is just as \"original\" as the denoised output. I doubt you're going to win much acclaim with it, though.", "2021": "Ok Dwight lol-\n\nYes but we\u2019re talking about the realm of experience which is functionally inexhaustible and is not the same as the realm of existing art. This includes both that which is peculiar or unique about the artist at birth which makes its way into the work as well as the life experience of the artist which is singular.  Impressionism did not exist before the impressionists, no one had painted Van Gogh\u2019s works before he \u2018saw\u2019 the movement of the world and gave color to it. \n\nYou\u2019d have to be a solipsist to deny this.\n\nEdit: This sub is ridiculously circlejerky", "2022": "If you write a word \"abubachakranism\" it might be a completely new word or even a definition of a new art movement that didn't exist until that second.

Not like anyone has actually invented a word, it was always a combination of the existing symbols and patterns, like a book is a combination of the existing words, and the art works representing concepts described in those books and the world around us. Complex combinations generated by our neural systems. \n\nAs for the \"unique\"-related part of your messages, there are things that are nearly impossible to either prove or disprove. One may say that a certain style is a result of a childhood trauma and unique combination of experiences (lol combination again), while some other guy will say it's just a different interpretation of the existing drawing techniques. As for me, I wouldn't say that drawing style is a result of something magically unique if that style can be repeated in millions of variations by some AI model that just looked at it.", "2023": "Then perhaps you can give us some advice on how to make this sub less circlejerky?\n\nIs it by simply agreeing with you, a true authority of art?", "2024": "I know man!

I suggested that it was completely understandable to feel this way and was met with a torrent of downvotes. \n\nI don\u2019t think that saying all art is not simple a remix of previous art would be met with this much derision anywhere else- it\u2019s an objective fact. The reason it\u2019s downvoted so much here is that it\u2019s seen as a criticism of the thing that everyone here is so excited about. \n\nHow to fix it? I\u2019ve no idea. I reckon there\u2019s a group of people here who are incapable of technical art and felt like AI art gave them skills they previously didn\u2019t have, because of this the idea that it\u2019s lacking in any way offends them?

Many of the 70%+ are just.. failing to chase opportunities. Or failing to meet *even the LOWEST expectations* after repeated attempt after attempt.\n\n# Im not saying times haven't been bad for many. They definitely are. \n\nBut. How often do we see **wishful thinking ALONE to solve our problems?**\n\n Even europe, is one of the more generous governments often providing much more for it's citizens than America with twice the Gdp. All Europe does is use like 50% of taxes to benefit 100% of it's people.. \n\n# If you jump out of a airplane without a parachute. \n\n**Does one appear in your hands SOLELY via wishpower?**\n\nNo, it doesn't. Not saying our current shit social problems definitely couldn't be improved for everyone. \n\n> But it needs funding to happen.. Europe has much better social programs and uses like 50% of taxes to provide benefits for 100% of it's citizens.. The usa gets twice the gdp.. And it could technically provide twice as much with twice as much money.. It'd rather give billions of dollars to empty cornfields instead.\n\nThe government apparently spends 80,000$ a year on a prisoner.. yet have prisoner quotas.. Instead of proposing to give 10,000$ a year to 8x more people.. Does anyone see a problem here? it's not that the money doesn't exist.. It's that it's being spent on ways to perpetuate a status quo..\n\n# There could be merit to job protection propositions.\n\nBut they have had a whole year. They aren't trying to think of stuff. Like idk, Proposals for job protection acts, profit sharing, or incentives for companies to look after them. But just saying the quiet parts out loud, that many of them only 'want' 'ethical ai' 'they don't actually WANT' 'To slow things down, DUH, OF CORSE stupid'. \n\nAnd this is their argument to a entire world governments?, And multi billion dollar corporations with multi million dollar lawyers? \"Feed us, because we hate you?\" \n\nLike others said. When they picked the job they wanted. And it didn't pay enough, maybe it mistreated them or took them for granted. They looked, saw their job didn't pay them what they wanted. so they switched to one that did.\n\nIt feels like when these people looked. They took it as their self given directive to try and force things. Like it was the world's fault. \n\n# Pre ai, even way back in [2018]( \n\n> **50% of artists earned less than 10% of their total income** from art and often relied on traditional jobs to make ends meet even **5 years prior to ai's existence.**. Only 20-25% found employment fully utilizing a art degree within 5 years. Just like how many musicians and ballerina and theatre majors don't find employment with their degrees. Or college footballers after their 50s. \n\n> Less than 10% of artists were able to live off **art for longer than 20 years**. And only 10% said they were able to find full time employment over 40 hrs a week. This was pre ai.. **A field only 10% of people made a living in never sounded highly lucrative even before ai existed..** Yet it's some of the most toxic behavior over such a meager wage.\n\nThat isn't saying there were problems. Indeed there are many. And if they're happy and making stuff for fun or self creation/fun/their community. Good, im all for that. But it's often 'expressed' as feelings of frankly, pure hatred, demonization, screaming, insults, brigaded harassment. It's hard to feel like it's a 'well reasoned, mature thoughts worth listening too' and less just constant noise screamed out during a tantrum. By people never taught to think about their kid's future's first, the 'do it for yourself' crowd Vs a ['do it for them, your family']( kind of mindset. \n\nBut just.. Some or many are literally at the 30-56+ year in bio stage. Sure 12-16 year old bios are a dime a dozen.. But the trashed 'beginner' artists weren't 1 year beginners.. But sometimes 35-56 year old people who [\"spent\" \"10 years\" on 'the craft'](  Scream and do what you want. Fuck the consequences mindsets.  I know that is insulting.. But if these 'master' self labeled  '35-56 year old' 'beginning' artists need the world bubble wrapped for them... I have no honest words....\n\nThere's some excuses for children. But when does bubble wrap for the world wear out it's welcome for 30+/++ year old adults?? 87???  \n\n# If history repeats itself.  \n\nThey just seem to loop over [Wish you away 'solutions']( Or the 'usual'...

'mentality', etc.  \n\n\n# If we lived in abundant times.\n\nThen money on *\"art\"* would be nothing than spare money. People would have **excess to throw around willy nilly**.\n\n# But Excess Abundance ISN'T Abundant right now\n\nTo most people in the economy.. Times are lean.

This means that in order to stand out you need to put the effort back in, for example to produce an entire graphic novel for the same effort that a single image used to take. \n\nHowever, this paradigm wouldn\u2019t last long because the whole idea of standing out itself is obsolete- we are on the fringes of tailored personalised art so in other words the user does make the art, but only for themselves. \n\nAnd at that point, although the only thing that changes is the audience size, we see a reversion back to a sense that the AI was made for \u201cme\u201d.

This gets to the heart of the philosophy of art anyway- does it consist in the artists intentions or the viewer\u2019s interpretation for example. \n\nThen again, when the art is being made for us, it will be prompted by that part of us which is unconscious, thereby detracting further from a sense of identifying with the creating entity.

Let me ask you...are you seeing alot of AI art that you feel is as good as a human created piece? I see a few but not many. I see alot that I enjoy looking at. It has obvious flaws but then some nice features as well. \n\nWhat I enjoy about AI. Do I consider myself an artist when creating in AI? Not really. I have other mediums for that. AI is a toy, a way of visualizing ideas. Some of what I make I like but most i dont. I dont have enough control of AI at this point to consider i have enough control of the output. I cannot claim to craft in AI like i do in 3d or photoshop. Ben too long since i touch pencil or brush so i cant claim those. \n\nLet me ask you in all honesty a few things. Do you feel that your identity as an artist and as a person is threatened by AI? That the threat against the one also threatens the other? If you lost your ability to create artwork would you be basically the same person? \n\nThank you for the sane reply. My only experiences with anti-ai people have ben of rabid dogs.

Any advantage to incorporating it?", "2349": "The thing is, as labor needs are decreased, so does the supply of goods increase. Labor goes down, meaning you make less, but supply skyrockets while demand stays as infinite as ever, meaning eventually all automated goods no longer make sense to sell, and would rather just be distributed. \n\nThis isn't a flaw of capitalism in my opinion, it's the goal. To encourage so much growth that the technological boon from it develops post-scarcity automation, automatically obsolescing itself. We need to remember that capitalisms whole goal, the same as any economic system, is to satisfy unlimited demand with limited supply. It we can automate infinite supply, then demand has been satisfied, and economics as we know it would be a relic of the past.", "2350": "The thing is, throughout the history of automation we've always found new jobs to do in relation to that automation. And at the point where labor has no use because automation supplanted the entire need, we've answered the fundamental question of Economics, and we would no longer need (or care about) capitalistic systems.\n\nCapitalism also says that when a good has no value due to excessive surplus, people will give it away freely as supply and demand start to be met. Yeah, people will be \"poorer\", but *everything* is infinitely cheaper, until literally everything is free, simply because the infinite demand no longer has limited supply.\n\nCapitalism is for before a post scarcity world.

And that\u2019s assuming everything they own could even be sold at face value.\n\nAnd what do you think our government will do with that money? Eliminate poverty? No, it's gonna be laundered through corporate bailouts and other shit that doesn't benefit the people you think it will.\n\nWe can't even begin to have the UBI talk until we eliminate wasteful government spending.\n\n>And the idea that the labor pool will always have a place to shift is unrealistic, when talking about combining automation with artificial intelligence.\n\nWhy?

(except nintendo, and they probably don't talk with their marketing team when they do that).\n\n It was clear to me that it was a double standard when some content creators and social media people were criticising the Corridor Crew's \"anime\" because 'they didn't create the style!' and I was like... yeah, say that as if people cared about a decades old anime series created by an animation studio and as if it wasn't obvious that people only know about this anime because of piracy. \n\n After that I decided the following. Either they stop consuming content from piracy sources, make every fan artist to stop their commisions that way, cancel every content creator that has no authorization for making gameplays of the games they play and convince everyone from the social media to not use copyrighted content for banners or icons, OR every argument that implies I am doing something \"bad\" will be ignored instantly.   \n Consistency is the basis of logic after all, if you ignore it for the sake of your argument it just makes sense for me to also not be consistent and ignore your argument for whatever reason i want.", "2427": "As long as they didn\u2019t make any money from it, isn\u2019t it just fan art?", "2428": "I wonder if certain anti-AI individuals got the rights to the Genshin Impact characters before using them as their avatars, since it would be wrong to steal someone else\u2019s character and all.", "2429": "Day 423 since AI art , luddites still don't understand that copyright infringement is measure in the **output**.

The people involved in the picture that spawned this thread are using copyright as a weapon, rather than a shield, and that is a bad thing. Fanart has been a long-term passtime for artists for longer than a good chunk of us have been alive, but selectively going \"AI Art shouldn't be allowed to make fanart\" is hypocritical and just flat out idiotic.

All I'm saying is that \"they\" always say things against AI relating to copyright law as their foundation, but looking further you see a whole history of support of copyright-infringement content (like the ones I mentioned) of this same people.

I\u2019m saying that I have the right to use a tool that is available to everyone and that does not cause any harm to anyone (at least not in a way that has been convincing yet). I\u2019m also aware of the legal and moral consequences of my actions, even if \"they\" aren't about theirs.\n\nI must say it's really interesting to find a \"professional logician\". What an odd profession of sorts, never heard of that before! Maybe you studied philosophy or were more focused on the studies of propositional logic? I'm always learning things in this community it's actually impressive, although I have the impression this profession might not add much for me for some reason... But since we're into it, I studied logic too you know? It was propositional logic focused on computer engineering though, which is a lot more mathematical then it needed to be. But since you're a professional of sorts, what about I do a example of dedutive reasoning using it, that should make it clear enough right?\n\nA: you use AI to make characters from other people or companies\n\nB: you use any traditional art method to make characters from other people or companies\n\nC: it's a copyright infringement\n\nD: you should be sued and suffer\n\nA -> C, C -> D => A -> D;\n\nThat's reasonable, it's a simple hypothetical syllogism and returns a tautology.

Instead, we should go with \\~D:\n\nB -> \\~D\n\nBut there's no way of getting that with the original premisses, unless we assume that C->\\~D is true and therefore:\n\nB -> C, C -> \\~D => B -> \\~D\n\nBut if the premise C -> \\~D is true that implies that:\n\nA -> C, C -> \\~D => A ->\\~D;\n\nAnd if we also assume A as true we get:\n\nA -> D, A -> \\~D, A;\n\nOn which is a contradiction, and trying to say otherwise doesn't make sense by definition (because in order to \"make sense\" it must make \"logical sense\", unless you belive fallacies \"make sense\").

You can't convince a person who wants to believe they come from Jesus, and that the garden of eden is in their backyard in Jackson Missouri, and Noah built a war boat without any plans for water, poop disposal, fresh greens, and/or space for the oddly numerous 600 million species of beetles and bugs out there. \n\nThey like that believe since it makes them feel morally superior to you, and while some people use christanity as a message about morals. \"Love thy neighbor, treat others as you'd like to be treated.\" |Let him without sin cast the first stone.

You can see people work 20 hours on something and the sfw piece only gets like 10-16 views if it's not cute. Then someone posts a unapproved nsfw edit and it gets 1000s. it's really stupid.

As you said, you are going to have a degree of control over what you want to receive from the generator, but no matter how you look at it: \n\nAfter you press the generate button, it's only the result of a trained algorithm that wouldn't work had it not been for a set of data (not mentioning that data would be, in its majority, taken from artists without their knowledge regardless);\n\nIf you had complete control over it OR of it took the same amount of work to make it when compared to real art, you'd choose to make it yourself, not feed it to an image generator and set multiple conditions to narrow down the possible results.\n\nHell, even if you don't have complete control over it, that's what art is all about.

It is definitely less work and skill than making these images from scratch without AI.  There is less personal expression too.  I quit using the word 'art' about ten years ago (despite still putting 'artist' on linkedin to get jobs).  Yah I make commercial 'content' I suppose.  Video game graphics.  In the games industry there have become so many jobs where the term artist is used (rigging artist, really?) that have reduced the meaning to dust a long time ago, so I just ran an experiment of 'what if I just never used the word art or artist?' in navigating my day to day work and lo and behold... nothing changed.  \n\nThe word art really means nothing in the industry.  When I started making games in the 80s, for fun, people did not call you an artist, and it wasn't art, you were the person making the graphics.  It was only in the late 90s that the whole 'artist' thing started to really kick in and people from outside of 'computer graphics' with more traditional backgrounds started to come in.  Yah I started doing 3D because 2D sprites were no longer commercially viable, then taking drawing and painting seriously came after as well because I wanted to compete with the big boys who got the respect.\n\nBut the people I work with now who use the term art, call themselves artists, obsess about it and focus so much on identifying themselves with the word and the idea of the title are having the hardest time of all this AI/ML stuff.  Do I call it AI Art?  Nah, generated images or something like that.  I quit calling the 3d models or 2d concepts I made 'art' too.  Why bother?  It is work for hire illustration at best, where the vast majority of the impulse behind it is to simply produce products for money and entertainment, escapism ultimately.  So for me 'Here we are, guess that's how the world works now' isn't that different than when I dropped the term art 10 years ago to describe what I do, with zero effect.  \n\nSure, society will have it's range of responses (lawyers and judges please duke it out!) and I would be very surprised if across the board collectively society adopted the same attitude of 'Here we are, guess that's how the world works now' but for me personally it fits for the moment.

Ever the stuff that hasn't been curated by humans has had some broad analytics done on it to determine source and reliability, and likely some passes through an earlier AI model as well.\n\nWith the success AI has started to see, the next generation will likely be a big step forward since the investment capital is now there in a real way to pay for the tagging you inexplicably think won't happen, despite it literally being the most obvious way to improve the models.

Also, what's to stop me from simply tracing an image in photoshop that I generated in AI? There are so many low level ways around this it's inSANE.

Its a big problem with these definitions.\n\n*old post;*\n\n\u1da0\u1d58\u207f \u1da0\u1d43\u1d9c\u1d57, \u1da6\u207f \u1d43\u1d49\u02e2\u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u1d57\u1da6\u1d9c

I see these guys having the same reactions as amateur artists. Depends on the person, but it's really not an annoying question for people to ask about your process.\n\nThe main difference I see is how personal art is, showing your feelings and views to outsiders, vs how impersonal other professions can be, having a clearer separation between things you do for yourself regardless of other's opinions, and selling product that's _all about_ providing a service that caters to other's needs.\nIn art those 2 are often intertwined in a balance between \"finding your stile\" and \"finding your audience\" if you want to make a business out of it.", "3259": ">Are we really getting to the point where the things we fucking type into search bars are seriously considered works of art or skillfully produced IPs?\n\nUnfortunately, yes. That's what AI art is, a glorified google images search that is blending up existing artwork to get closer to what you asked for.

It's not like we were purposely trying to prevent others from learning; the opposite is true. It was just that to truly create it all yourself takes time and some discipline (and still does, AI doesn't let you 'truly create it all yourself').", "3269": "It's actually kinda stupid, because if you don't show your workflow in this, it's kinda impossible to prove that you had enough human input into the image to hold copyright\u2026 so while they might think they're keeping the gold vein to themselves, ANYONE CAN TAKE IT.\n\nI guess Midjourney doesn't tell their users that (they say that the user owns the image IIRC), which is annoying. I think a lot of this conflict is entirely Midjourney's fault.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly ironic because like you said, the automation won\u2019t stop at the visuals, especially since handling text is even easier, and soon enough there might even be an algorithm for \u201ctrending ideas\u201d or whatever Midjourney tries to do to squeeze money out of people. The prompts are in their hands, after all, which I guess a lot of people forget about. They\u2019re feeding the company all the information the company could ever wish for.\n\nI\u2019ve watched enough videos to see that a lot of people think that when this \u201cproduct\u201d is being pushed by corporations and when the visuals are better than what humans make, that would be the end of art.\n\nI think that only people who are easily manipulated by algorithms would actually consume that, because I feel like a lot of people like art for other reasons. Going that route also takes away the appeal the technology would have for artists entirely because it turns you into a consumer, not a creator. Personally, that is not what I would ever want from it, and I know many others feel the same way.\n\nOne thing that I found interesting about Stable Diffusion stuff in particular is that it felt to me like it was kinda\u2026 \u201cscientific\u201d, because there is this reproducibility to what you make with it, if you want to prove you got there.\n\nI don\u2019t think that being able to reproduce has ever been something that art liked in the past, but to anyone genuinely trying to use SD as an artistic tool, I find it interesting how the best thing to do is to show all your steps, how you got to that image, almost as if the \u201cformula\u201d is part of the piece.\n\nI don\u2019t remember where I heard it, but it was something along the lines of \u201ctrue masters aren\u2019t afraid to show their secrets\u201d or something like that.", "3270": "\"\"\"\"\"\"skills, time and effort\"\"\"\"\"\"", "3271": "The difference it's that you actually create music.

Melodies are only finite if you constrain the number of notes, key, and note length. ([This article]( does some nice number crunching and explanation)\n\nYou're comparing apples to oranges. Sheet music is nothing like prompting an AI with a couple of words to create art for you based a database of millions of pieces of stolen art", "3273": "I kinda disagree because I feel like the \u201cmethod of creation\u201d is so different here that the analogy doesn\u2019t apply.

I\u2019m kinda against this idea of trying to apply universal rules to things that are radically different, because it\u2019s almost never useful. You don\u2019t try to describe the growth of a population of rabbits through quantum mechanics.\n\nI think it\u2019s different with diffusion models because you\u2019re wandering around OUTSIDE your head, in something someone else made.\n\nAs someone who likes exploring around in Minecraft, an analogy I could make is that it\u2019s actually closer to that\u2026 you can generate many worlds with different seeds, looking for a specific terrain formation, one that looks just right, one that you imagined, and you\u2019re trying to find it. Given enough generation, and maybe using things like a biome finder\u2026 if you do find it, did you create it?\n\nI agree that in diffusion models it is even more of a grey area, because the text part of the prompt might give the illusion that you\u2019re telling your idea to the machine\u2026 but I can say with confidence that the current models ARE NOT good enough for that to be the case. If they were, then seed navigation wouldn\u2019t really be necessary. Instead, the prompt is more like knobs that you can turn to kinda control where it\u2019s going.\n\nMy main argument for that is that using these models like that is intrinsically deterministic. Same prompt, same parameters, same model, same image.\n\nThe moment you touch it with any other input (like img2img using something you made), that is GONE. And I guess that\u2019s where I draw the line.\n\nNow, if you want to say that finding the right prompt and combination of parameters is the act of creation, then sure, but that\u2019s like making a map, which is what I meant. If anyone follows those directions, using the same system, they can make the EXACT SAME IMAGE, BY THE PIXEL. Music aside, that\u2019s not really a thing that can be done in other visual media.\n\nI\u2019m kind of a middle man here, because while I do agree with a lot of artists that the non-consented training of models is bad, and I wouldn\u2019t want to take advantage of that, I actually want this technology and I\u2019d love to use it in my workflow (so I\u2019ve been experimenting with it to learn).\n\nWhen I spawn an image just by prompting, I never felt like it was \u201cmine\u201d, because I know that it\u2019s coming from other people. To me it\u2019s a weird (forced) collaboration between whoever worked on the models and all the artists the originated the training data.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s just me, but through prompting alone it feels like it\u2019s not coming from me.", "3274": "One can paint something, then paint the same thing again and again making identical paintings if they so choose. It's the same thing as your music analogy. The difference here being that our hypothetical painting, or composition was conceived by the original author, making it their creation, whereas the images being generated by the AI already exist in mathematical formula, and are found by prompting. One could argue that the AI itself is the author of the image, but one could never reasonably argue that the prompter is the author of the image. What a prompter does, is effectively the same thing as google searching for an image, saving it, then claiming they made it themselves.\n\nTo put the analogy back in musical terms, its like searching for, and downloading \"Shake it out\" by Taylor Swift, and then claiming you made that song.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah, I don't have an answer for the philosophical question whether or not one creates, or discovers, but if you really wanted a thought out response to that part, you wouldn't have made the text so small it hurts my eyes to read. I would say even if we call creation \"discovery\" then an artist is the first discoverer, and even still in that case, the AI has discovered that combination of pixels, not the prompter.", "3275": "That\u2019s so pathetic. Holy fuck humanity really fucked itself up. I always thought it was a basic human instinct not to feel proud about taking credit for work that someone else (AI engineers in this case) did for you. I always thought it was a basic human instinct to only take pride in things that took actual effort on your part. If typing something into a search bar is effort then we\u2019re gonna get to a point where lifting a finger is considered an applaudable Herculean task. \n\nI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re seriously at a point where if you even say something like the above to these AI bros they\u2019re gonna call you a boomer. I\u2019m not even joking at this point this is all just fucking sad.", "3276": "Much of what they write could be a copypasta by this point tbh, \"*you luddite*\", lol.", "3277": "Reminds me of:\n\n this person seems more in the \"demystify so people will have at it\" crowd, but s/he makes a fair point.", "3278": "You clearly haven't met my coworkers :pensive_face: /s", "3279": "because they are bozos", "3280": "Do you think \u201cprompts\u201d is a marketing term?

I personally have spent many hundred hours over the years in online communities giving feedback, answering specific questions, compiling tutorials and practice materials as well as making correction paint-overs, all for free. All for the joy of helping others on their artistic journey.\n\nI think so far I have not seen any artist that was taken seriously try to hide their \"secrets\". If someone was secretive it was usually because they cheated by tracing, thus not actually having much genuine skill. In some way, showing your process and sharing your techniques is proof that you're the genuine article.", "3282": "The main difference is that tutorials are consensual. People make a tutorial because they want to share. The expectation with AI is that its more of a requirement for every post (even somewhat in AI circles) which some people don't like. (yes yes image scraping debate, but the controversies/ethics of the AI companies and users are different)\n\nThe main problem is that as AI art gets more complex, it becomes much less copy pasting info, but like writing a whole report because you used an image for controlnet here, then a different prompt was used for this process, photoshop was used to deal with xyz here, etc etc. \n\nImagine that with every piece you made, you had to write a corresponding report on what decisions you made, why, and how. Its kind of just annoying if anything.\n\nUltimately, while I support people sharing prompts/workflows as an expectation. I don't think it should be a requirement.", "3283": "A lot of good points here. I have tried to write up a few replies, but I kinda always went on a tangent or two or three.\n\nIn the end, I assume the big reason for hiding the workflow or prompts is that it would just reveal how little actual human input into an actually good looking image there was.\n\nOn the other hand, I have seen AI tutorials about using img2img in an AI generated image to increase control, and it seemed extremely inefficient and slow. An actual artist would have been far faster and the result would have looked better (which is why I assume most good looking AI images are almost entirely done by AI with only slight touchups and no further human input).", "3284": "They\u2019re some of the most depressingly un-self aware people I\u2019ve ever seen.

No its a sentence, nothing special about it. Sick of people acting like spending an hour or two on a prompt is a lot of time to make art, you people are so fucking delusional.", "3287": " Compared the amount of writting I do on a day, that's mild stuff. Some people also write as well as drawing.\n\n The problem is not consent here. The problem is this kind of attitude the people who blame artists for being \"gatekeeprs with dirty secrets\" doing such a thing and keeping a small paragraft of text to themselves. That's hypocrisy.", "3288": "It\u2019s really a matter of technology, and right now it\u2019s unfortunately not very well optimized for artist control but at least in Stable Diffusion things are getting better.\n\nUsing img2img alone is not very good for control, because what actually happens is that it gets interpreted as noise and then denoised into what the model wants to make from it. This can cause a very annoying dance between having too much denoising and losing your original composition (which might spawn eldritch abominations), or too little and having an image that looks like a scuffed version of your input.\n\nInstead, using ControlNet is pretty much a must for composition, with img2img being more useful for controlling lighting and color, from what I noticed, but there is a lot to be investigated and learned, of course.\n\nNot fighting against the model is also important, which is why img2img alone can be very suboptimal sometimes. If a model wasn\u2019t trained on what you\u2019re trying to do (say trying to do a dragon in a model for humans only), it will fail a lot more.\n\nMaking an image look good can also involve a lot of inpainting and knowing when to upscale and how, and I guess people who go deep into this can also do a lot more, like using latent couple and multidiffusion (for using different prompts for separate parts of the same image), as well as model-swapping through the pipeline or using LoRAs and other additional networks in creative ways (like combining style LoRAs with negative weights for unique effects).\n\nThe end result of that would be impossible to replicate with prompts alone (especially latent couple since it\u2019s otherwise VERY HARD to prompt different unique-looking characters in the same picture).\n\nThat said I think I\u2019m still with you on assuming that it\u2019s prompts-only more often than not. As it is the easiest thing to do, it\u2019s expected to be the most commonplace. I think it\u2019s important to share the workflow because of that, but forcing or judging people could feel a bit rude, I guess. I hope people end up understanding this, and it foments a culture of sharing the workflow by default, as a mark of pride or something, like \u201clook, I didn\u2019t just prompt this actually, I worked on it a lot and I can hold copyright\u201d.", "3289": "AI means artificial intelligence. Nowhere in the definition is sapience or even sentience implied. It is intelligence that is artificial. These art generators are doing intelligent things artificially. So that qualifies as artificial intelligence. Low level, sure, but still AI. \n\nI have Stable Diffusion on my laptop. It\u2019s been idling for about a month (I have a bad habit of not turning my computer off) and so far it hasn\u2019t generated anything. Why is that? Surely the program is the one responsible for the art? So far it only generates images whenever I interact with it. What gives?

But it is a valid perspective that they don't want to be forced to write a long document for every post they make.

People use so many addons, extensions, and external tools nowadays that just copy pasting the main block of info just is not enough to recreate the image. That's the problem. Its not a paragraph anymore\n\nI do wish the metadata would stick onto the images when posted on social media though.

Here is what I learned from inside the AI circle. Obviously from that title I should start with my 'credentials'. Back in August/September of 2022 I rented 6xA100 instances and made one of the first kink focused furry models, Zack3D_Kinky. Since then v1 has been downloaded over 10 thousand times directly, and my seedbox has a ratio of 1000. (4gb model and has uploaded 4tb of data while having 46 other seeders). This obviously got quite the attention and with it I joined the Ai community as a model creator.  \n\nSince then, I have become the bottom rung of the furry ai community, a model maker who cared about artists and didn't put up with their shit once I started seeing the actual uses of ai models. I tried to at least make mine a middle-ground with v2, stripping artist names so no one person could be replicated, downsized the training data I used by 10x. It still made amazing images, but because of this I seemed to have ticked off a fair few people... which exposed the true point of AI.  \n\nA couple months ago I got called out on twitter by a good sized artist for ripping off an artists style, except I didnt. Someone in the AI community saw my stance and trained LoRA modules on my model, and posted them around. Because it had my model name front n center on the title, I got the flack. Why do this? Pure spite, which is what the Ai community runs on though and through. Remember SamDoesArt? That was the warning flag a lot of people ignored. For those unaware SamDoesArt is an artist who early on in the SD craze, requested that their art not be used to train models. Ai bros trained over 20 models on his art specifically right after that. I watched that from the *inside* happen many times. I know furry models that specifically got training data by scraping 'no-ai' tagged posts, I have seen furry artists have models made of them because 'oof too expensive', I have seen suggestions of getting a wip sketch from an artist and just using that with controlnet to make the final image while bailing on the artist. All of this happening while the top model creators actively joke about taking art from people, one of them even joked about people dying from being poor because \"its their fault for buying funkopops\" while soliciting donations for their ai model. That is what AI is, its 'these artists have been better than me and now I can steamroll them because I deserve to feel like the best'. One of the most telltale signs of this, is the common view on copyright. If I had a nickel for every discussion of 'copyright shouldn't exist at all, in any form' I would have my money back from those A100 instances. Ethics? Who cares about those I want my **popular artist name here** artwork of my character, but they charge a reasonable price and I cant afford it so...  \n\nAI art, in the most boiled down form, is becoming artist piracy. Just like people who don't pay for videogames, they now have a way to not pay for an artist, so why would they? Its legal too. Just grab up their artwork, feed it through a machine for 20 min, boom recreation of them. People say 'its just a toy' yet get mad about invisible watermarks on their images denoting it as AI, or end up making models of real people and putting them up online next to models that can make porn of those real people. The amount of people saying 'nothing wrong with models of real people, doesnt mean its for porn' while the next line down is 'they ripped out nsfw from the model so its garbage and never use it' is astounding. That alongside a fair few popular posts over in the stablediffusion subreddit having 'I know she looks underage but thats just the style\" on their big boobie to camera cleavage exposure.  \n\nBecause of all of this, a few weeks ago I decided to cease creation of models as my project. With that I got one of the best summaries of the ai community.  \n\nI posted my announcement, and within an hour someone sent me a screenshot. It was of one of the top furry model makers posting my announcement and calling me a '(artist) simp' and right below that was 2 messages from different people.  \n\n\"dude was an asshole\" and then \"we were never mean to him\"  \n\nIts just delusion, circlejerking, and power over artists. That is what makes the Ai community big, and is the 3 key pillars to being a successful model maker. Don't let them tell you otherwise.  \n\nIf you have any questions about what I have seen feel free to ask, I dont mind talking about it.\n\nEdit: Bonus thing I forgot to mention that was a massive warning sign for me. There is a tool called Stable Horde, where you can run SD on your machines for others to generate on. After the release of my model I ran Stable Horde on a spare machine. It took 1 hour to have some attempt to blatantly generate... Cheese Pizza... lets just call it that since when you make it an acronym its the same. When I informed the maker of Stable Horde they at first **refused** to do anything about it as it is 'up to the horde worker'. Took me explaining that the entire Stable Horde worker setup said you just had to run it and let it be magic... so the amount of not care for that stuff is rough.\n\nEdit 2: Hello Furry Diffusion, I can see yall talking about this :). Let me address publicly what yall say because you dont want to ask or say it here for some reason. \"My real issue with this is the stuf he's saying about money. Like he claims the AI models are being made by the elite... Dude literally did this on a 3090. Zack paid for A100 instances.\" If you have a 3090, you are in less than 1% of PC owners. That makes you an elite, it costs thousands and thousands of dollars to train a model, and if you want it within a month I sure hope you have a thousand to drop on A100 instances like I did.

I don't really find this surprising since it seems like this toxic community and the AI one has a lot of overlap, it's a cult of people that hates artists because they worked hard to develop a skill for some reason.\n\nI remember that when newer SD models removed the NSFW there was a massive backlash, which is pretty funny since I don't really think any AI users have any genuine \"passion\" for making art. They just want to make porn and get an instant dopamine rush. Again I don't really find this surprising since the process of making AI art is so boring and monotonous that I doubt anyone would find it enjoyable, they only care about getting the end product.\n\nI'm glad that you experienced what this community was first-hand, and then decided that... maybe this wasn't a group that you want to associate with?

Not knowing who some of these folks were (all of them, actually) I did some tests, looked up their galleries, and tried to figure out what each of those names was providing.

I realize you can reply by saying \"I'm saying it *could or will,* not that it's already doing that when it comes to porn.\" But that's irrelevant, because your support for AI is predicated on it making creative activity exponentially faster and easier once it reaches its commercial potential, or else you'd just do things the traditional way. If it makes creative activity exponentially easier, it necessarily will make revenge porn exponentially easier to make too. Even if the official models aren't trained on porn in their datasets, a lot of nude art is included in those datasets that make AI generating porn possible and easy. Even if that's not an issue, people can make local models trained specifically on porn to make porn.\n\n>On the other hand artists generate tons of questionable art, they're the actual tanks and assault rifles and all should be banned.\n\nYou're misunderstanding the analogy. The photoshop users choosing to make \"questionable art\" are the muzzle loaders at home. In terms of scale, genAI is the tank and the assault rifle. If photoshop users make a total of X porn pics per year, genAI can multiply that by a million, and a much larger percentage of that will be porn made from ppl without consent. The problem isn't the existence of any tool that makes porn possible. The problem is the scale.\n\nTraditional and old school digital methods for making art require time and skill at minimum. The entire premise of genAI is that it doesn't require those things at minimum though you can bring those things optionally, or else it isn't \"democratizing\" art. The problem is that if you create a tool that requires little to no time and effort *at minimum* (which, again, is the premise of this tech or else it isn't \"democratizing\" anything) and make it accessible to the general populace, you're gonna open the floodgates wide, enabling countless faceless weirdos who'll suddenly come out of the woodwork with the ability to do real harm but without the discipline that would've likely taught them not to abuse that ability. On the other hand, the nature of traditional art and old school digital art methods necessarily deters a lot of people from even trying or persisting in those methods in the first place.\n\n>That's capitalism....  At least AI art will let people enjoy being creative without ...\n\nYou're moving the goalposts.

The other person was saying that on your own view, AI won't actually help you make the kind of profit or run the kind of enterprise you want. Instead of arguing why they're wrong, you blamed your future lack of profit on capitalism and therefore tacitly agreed with them that, yeah, your enterprises won't be profitable. Then you shifted the goalposts by saying \"well, it's just gonna make being creative easier.\"\n\nBesides, it's not just a capitalism issue. You wanna know why? Because without AI, being a content creator and doing other creative work WAS viable financially to a lot of people. With AI, it won't be. So what's the real immediate cause here? Capitalism minus AI equals financial viability for a lot of artists. Capitalism plus AI means entire creative fields become unprofitable except to big megacorps, and nothing except super strict regulation on AI specifically will ever remedy or prevent that.

Just because it's easier to take a photo of a landscape than it is to paint one, doesn't make either form less \"art\" if the creator still views it as an expression of them and their creativity.

The people who created these engines have given the right for others to use it\n\nThis is why I brought up Picrew and portrait makers in my previous comment as those are what is closer to game engines rather than AI.

Same with AI. I already played with it a bit and felt that, AI is good for \"passable\" stuff, and there are situations this is enough to satisfy people (not everyone has high requirements anyway), but it is not creative and can't get too far from obvious and standard stuff.\n\nI also noticed in some contexts people are actually improving in noticing the AI illustrations: it's like the premise of Turing Test but inverted, with so much AI generated stuff around, now its humans who are being trained on spotting it.

And anytime \"I\" created ai \"art\", it just felt like I was wasting my time. Something else more productive could be done. Something else more accomplishing. Here's the thing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be an animator and artist. It's something I've always dreamed of being ever since watching my favorite movie of all time, Meet the Robinsons. Breathing life into characters and making them feel, act, and resonate with us is something I want to do. The same can be said for artwork as well. But anytime \"I\" create \"artwork\" with AI, I feel like I'm not getting closer to my goals. I'm not learning anything. And after spending hours of debating with myself in my tiny cramped room, it hit me:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are lazy and uncreative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are so uncreative that we delegate the creative process to an algorithm instead of ourselves. Some people even go as far as using ChatGPT for prompts, further showing that you are uncreative. We are so lazy that we bat an eye at the creative process and let an algorithm decide the fate of an art piece. We are so lazy to even learn how to draw even the most basic things; just let the robot handle it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd don't give me that \"we type our prompts\" bullshit. You have no bearing or control on the output. It is random. Even when using a ControlNet, you do not have control over the output, because if you did, you wouldn't have to play a game of lottery to find the best output. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the contrary, digital or traditional artwork is not random. It is all dependent on skill. I believe creating artwork is one of the most fair things in the universe. In a world of randomness where you don't know what is going to happen to you the next day, what the next project is, what you're going to eat, etc, artistry is not random. Each brush stroke has a meaning, and a purpose. What I love about art is that the barrier of entry is bar none. No matter if you are rich or poor, demonstrably intelligent or ill-informed, you can produce stunning artworks and worlds without the introduction of our world's biases. All it takes is some of your time, dedication, skill, and a pencil and a few piece of paper. If you're born digital like some of us, basic drawing tablets to get you started aren't that much more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are so lazy that we're willing to dump our creativity in favor for an algorithm's because we don't want to spend the time to learn the art form we aspire to be in. This is the biggest sticking point I've seen, and it's a trend in many areas, not just for AI \"art.\" Remember when you actually had to learn python? No, because just let ChatGPT do all the learning and work for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are entering an age where it is okay to be willingly lazy to achieve the things we want. Not just that, but it's also promoted to be lazy. Have a book report due soon? Just let ChatGPT or Claude do the report for you! Need to come up with some domain names for your own website? Let ChatGPT do all the hard thinking for you! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people might say that \"it's efficient.\" It is not. The fact that you have to go draft, fine-tune (prompt edit), and fix AI \"art\" goes to show that it is not efficient. Why go through all the lengths of fixing AI \"art\" when you know full well that the \"artwork\" will turn out mediocre. Things like light sources not making sense, body proportions being off, body parts being in impossible locations, bad perspecive, inconsistent artstyle- fixing any of these issues is not a simple ChatGPT solution. Fixing any of these things is going to require major overhauls of the \"art\" piece, which at that point, why not just fucking do the art piece from scratch?? Doing it from scratch is advantageous because: it is your work, not someone elses; it can be copyrighted; you learn new things and better yourself after each completed art piece; you can show it off to others and be proud of what you made; among other things such as it not being controversial since it does not use AI.\n\n \n\nAnother angle some people throw is that it \"allows anybody to create art without having huge time investments\" which is another way of saying that we are lazy and don't want to invest time learning art. If you don't have the time to create or learn how to create art, there is another way to create art without the use of AI... commissions! You can commission a fellow artist to create your own vision for you! Not only can you have direct contact with the artist so you and them can see eye to eye on your project, it can also be copyrighted. Not to mention that it also supports the artist's lively hoods and upholds the career that they wanted to pursue. And--the best part--it is not random! You know exactly how your idea will come to fruition since, again, you are in direct contact with the artist who can send you updates every step of the way, and you know the artist's style since you can see their portfolio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I always reference now is how real artwork pricing is comparative to AI \"artwork.\" There's a reason why real artwork costs hundreds of dollars to commission: it's because of the time spent on both the project and the experience that got them to this skill level, the passion and dedication that the artist is willing to spend on your commission, and the price they believe that their artwork is worth. On the contrary, AI \"art\" commissions/artworks are worth pennies because they are so easy to produce and make. Deviant art is a good example. There are AI \"artists\" that allow you to adopt their \"artworks.\" It's basically another way of saying \"I sell the rights of this character/artwork to you.\" They are all sold at $5 USD. And there are tons of them. Do any of them sell? Fuck no! There is an influx of AI \"art\" adoptions that nothing ever gets sold, and not to mention that you can make these yourself easily and for FREE! Why the fuck would anyone buy these?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother angle I see people say is that it \"lowers the barrier of entry to create artwork\" they say as they have RTX 3090/4090's in their computers. What barrier to entry? As I stated before, the barrier to entry to create artwork is bar none. At it's most simplest, all you need is a pencil and paper. Hell, you don't even need paper! Cavemen used walls! If their talking about skill, then no fucking duh. In order to create master artworks, you need to be a master at art. Simple as. Again, I stated before, that artwork is entirely based on skill. The more skilled you are, the better your artwork can be. If you're not willing to even go as far as watch a few free art tutorials available on YouTube because it's too \"time dependent\", then being an artist might not be for you. Better stick to commissioning artworks; there's no shame in doing that! Lastly, it does lower the barrier of entry to create shit artwork fast, that is true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last argument people throw is that \"the invention of the calculator didn't affect anything or any jobs; it just made computing faster. The same can be said for AI art.\" No. The invention of the calculator DID affect jobs, severely. Seriously, 10 seconds of google searching can point you to the answer. There was at one point a job occupation labeled \"Computer.\" This was at a date and time before electronic computers became commercially available, and the job's description is \"one who computes.\" It's a person who performs mathematical calculations. Groups of people, often women, were used to undergo long and often tedious calculations; so much so that the work would be divided amongst them so that it can be done in parallel. The calculations would often be double checked by a third party to make sure the results were correct. The invention of electrical computers/calculators absolutely had a hand in replacing these jobs. Think about it from a company perspective: Why pay out tons of money for mathematical calculations that would take weeks for teams of humans to do, when you could invest in a calculator/electrical computer to do the work for you in mere hours for less the cost overtime? Not only the computer did things faster than humans, it was also nearly error free since the calculations are almost certainly correct. Think. The obvious answer is that a company would pick the computer over the humans, even if it incurred a big initial cost. The same thing can most definitely happen to artists, even if the output that AI generates is shittier than that of a human.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this, and I still haven't even mentioned checkpoint/lora training that steal living artist's work. The SamDoesArt AI \"controversy\" goes to show that AI bros do not want you creating artworks. They want a robot that creates artworks like you. If that wasn't the case, then why are there tons and tons of artist loras/checkpoints available for download on CivitAI every single day? And don't give me that \"you can't copyright styles\" bullshit. Your intention is literally to copy an artists style as a form of impersonation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could go on and on, but I don't want this to turn into the bible, so I'll just say this: If you're an AI bro reading this and don't understand anything said here, maybe you need ChatGPT to explain it to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso as for me, I have completely erased everything related to AI on my system. All the checkpoints, loras, webui's, images, etc. I've also deleted my CivitAI account along with the all models I regret making.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to learn art from scratch the normal way. I don't want to rely on a crutch.", "3758": "Somebody needs to tell the AIbros the old business dictum: cheap, fast, or good -- pick two.  You can use AI to make something cheap and fast for you, but it won't be good.", "3759": "Glad to hear it! Yeah I can't begin to describe how silly/infuriating it was to see all this unfold a year ago from an artist's perspective. The \"democratized art\" thing is idiotic and just an excuse for laziness and theft. The theft thing is the kicker. It'd be one thing if people chose to do unhealthy things if they were the only ones hurt by it, but this has all been damaging to many many artists out there. \n\nGrab a pencil and paper and start drawing. Find one of infinite tutorials put out there by pros. Bam. Democratized. \n\nSpeaking of which here's a link with a bunch of learning material.

The end goal of this tech is for all humans to be obsolete. \n\nHumans need purpose and challenges. If we have nothing to strive for then that is dangerous.

(4-5 days a week is also good.). Love doing landscape? Do small thumbnails, love drawing character? Do small concepts...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more you do it, the more you get use to it, it will become a habit like brush your teeth or take a shower, it become easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more you do it, the more you learn and start adding things like visual story telling, deeper meaning, emotional connection ... ,instead of just a cool picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more you do it, the more your taste and creativity will grow. AI can't fix bad taste, you have to do it yourself by creating and consuming arts that matter to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more you do it, the clearer your vision become, you slowly build up your dream personal project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaking good art is not only about skills, but also about passion, art is a mirror that reflect artist's soul, so if you love your art, that love will show on your art and the audience (Especially your fan) can see it too. If you are being inauthentic or hating your art, it will show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you try to copy someone else art style, your preference, life experience, perspective still shape your style and you will see you own uniqueness. Also don't compare yourself to other artist, it is the best way to be miserable, if you can not find where you belong then focus on your own vision and build your own paradise, may be someday others may want to join you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[", "3763": "For me it's obvious, if someone doesn't want to dedicate their time and energy to create something with their own brain and hands (or feet lol, I've seen artists with no arms learning how to paint with a foot or mouth), then it clearly means they DON'T WANT to be an artist. They just want to consume all the benefits that a creating artist earns through hard work, by putting as little work as possible. But the feeling of true fulfillment won't come in this way. So AI generators are tools created for this exact kind of people, for those who don't find any enjoyment in improving themselves, they just want to pretend like they are in the same group along with real artists. But they are not, and will never be with this attitude. \n\nA silly comparision: it's like a difference between being pregnant and finally giving a painful birth of your beloved baby you had inside for so long, and after all the struggle being revarded by the sight of your own baby that nobody will ever take away from you... and ordering a bootleg baby from Wish.", "3764": "Glad u have woken up.

You're just doing constant trial and error, this isn't skill.  It's like tuning numbers in a particle emitter in a game engine, except you need to use words and you don't know what it is going to tune, so you keep typing in new shit in it until it looks about how you would expect.

They have videos about posing too, I find posing is one of those ways to really help visually give life to characters like you sorta mentioned being inspired by!\n\nIf you want to improve at anatomy quickly, grab a bunch of reference photos of some people, I use adorkastock but there are other people who uploaded reference images as well. You can either put the images to the side and try and draw what you see onto the page. When I really struggled with anatomy I also used a lightbox/making a layer more transparent, this is tracing, but for the sake of practice it is actually a little important. All artists trace or mimic styles at some point when they're just learning, so long as you don't post anything traced as your own, I think it's actually good practice for your helping to give your fingers a bit of muscle memory.\n\nWhen you feel a more confident in your ability to draw people with a reference photo to the side, you should practice giving yourself a timer. I was taught this as a way to improve how much time it takes to draw someone. Take one photo of a pose, and give yourself 3 minutes to draw as much of it as you can. Don't worry if you miss some parts just keep going. Go down to 2 minutes and 30 seconds, 2 minutes etc down to 30 seconds. So this exercise maybe like twice a week, in between treat yourself with drawing something you like and don't give yourself a time limit.\n\nIf you do this even for two weeks, your art will improve dramatically.

People not only lack empathy, but there's a dehumanization of human-made art with terms like \"data\" describing its function in AI. Conversely, there's a humanization of AI's function with terms like \"learning\", \"understanding,\" \"reasoning,\" \"decision-making,\" \"problem-solving,\" \"perception,\" \"creativity,\" \"hallucination,\" \"intuition.\"\n\nThe long-term benefits are unclear to me. While there's undeniable profit in gathering data on human behavior and thought, products like Meta's AR glasses, Neuralink, and potential BCIs from Valve raise concerns. I see the potential for profit, but I'm struggling to understand the ultimate goal. The reality is that there probably isn't one from the perspective of the people developing it, (not to say that there isn't an ultimate goal from the perspective of reality) and that it is primarily driven by corporate profit and domination, and secondarily people with a drive to innovate with no concern over the repercussions of doing so, whether it's just personal feelings of achievement or monetary gain. Regardless it is no coincidence to me that Meta, Microsoft, and other companies are simultaneously spending lots of money on both AI development and metaverse development.\n\nImitating and manipulating human behavior and thought can lead to mind control, which is desirable for governments and corporations seeking power, obviously, an endeavor that's been desired forever. There's already a level of manipulation that is happening with advertisement connected to your purchase history, web history, watch history, etc. What happens when there's no longer value in the people using your products? What happens when they are no longer valuable to society because AI accomplishes what they are capable of doing? Isn't there a point where humans would just be viewed as unnecessarily upkeep? Will it lead to power struggles between corporations with advanced AI? What about the displaced humans who were previously running the AI, rendered obsolete by self-sufficient, self-improving, self-replicating systems? This isn't even getting into questions like, how do you reason with something that inherently lacks reasoning? How could something seemingly so harmless literally be the death of people? How are people going to use it for harm? How are you going to accept that it is an inevitability and why is it worth this? This is certainly rendering humans obsolete but I don't understand why humans would desire this. This idea I keep hearing from AI bros that people will become free to do whatever they please makes absolutely no sense, and you don't have to look far back into history to see how oppression works.\n\nHaving layers of AI doesn't make it sentient, but it may deceive people into thinking so, posing challenges as society detaches from reality. As BCIs become commonplace, people might willingly enter a Matrix-like existence. What's gained from them? Perhaps data on decision-making in the virtual world, improving AI or NPC simulations. Is there a point where additional data from humans becomes unnecessary?\n\nGrowing brains in labs and sustaining disembodied brains is already partially a reality with recent advancements. I can imagine attaching neuralinks to such brains, trapped in a perpetual virtual world with no real body to escape to... Perhaps the virtual world would not need to match the fidelity of reality if all the minds experiencing it have no greater context of reality. Maybe those minds would not be considered human because they are just brains. Or if they mix X% of pig or monkey DNA they are considered nonhuman thus are not subject to human rights (another advancement being worked on). Could they be used as conduits for advanced AI? Can they be retired/destroyed with no reprecussion because what is reality to them is meaningless to an outside viewer, as they are \"just\" an organ? Some people seem to think nothing matters if they're happy. If I have a machine that makes me happy all the time should I or others be okay with doing slavework? Are you satisfied when you are happy in a dream? Do their emotions even matter to you if you know that their entire existence has been within a fake world, and you cannot perceive their thoughts or emotions? What if corporations or governments had farms of these in the name of improving the quality of the dataset that runs this simulation that you enjoy entering for fun to escape from the sadness of real life, that you in turn train? I believe the concept of The Matrix may become much more pleasant and humane than reality.\n\nMy imagination of a dystopian future aside...\n\nHuman art is an expression of one's life experiences, perspectives, knowledge, understanding, dedication, pursuit, and desires... Even something like commercial art can hold deeper meaning than on the surface, a story of someone taking this job, their goals trying to make this product, their desire to express their uniqueness even among other commercial art especially of the same company, for example. There's history in many levels, from what was around at the time that the art was made that led to what was created, what decisions did this person make as they were making it, like their brush strokes, the colors they chose, their ideas for how to impress the viewers...

I have objectively created images.\n\n>you are not learning\n\nThe images I created today are far better (in my opinion) than the images I created the day I downloaded [Easy Diffusion]( And it is because of a lot more than learning to prompt. I have learned more about composition and lighting. I have learned how to identify issues and correct them with inpainting. I have tried different tools to find the right one.\n\n>you are not really doing anything productive. \n\nI suppose that depends on what you consider productive.\n\n>You are playing with a machine created by stealing from artists that spend thousands of hours on honing their craft.\n\nNothing has been stolen. All of those original works still exist, they are not being distributed either. This is like saying that your art was created by a meat box that was educated by stealing from teachers. \n\n>You are just consuming.\n\nSometimes. Sometimes I am creating art for another use such as to represent my D&D character or a location. \n\n>>This sounds a lot like complaining  that a tractor took the job of a field hand.

There are plenty of people that can produce amazing works within a few short years of practice in just about every artistic medium. \n\n>That you need to spend 40+ hours a week honing your skills to achieve the level of mastery you take for granted?\n\nIf you spend 40 hours a week on anything you will hopefully improve. People that spend that time on AI art improve too. Many are even developing new tools themselves when they find the available tools fell short of their goal. \n\n>People were just barely scraping by to do what they loved. Now it will be impossible.\n\nAnd that sucks. But the same is true for plenty of work and from all sorts of technological advancements. \n\nPortrait painters list work when they invented the camera. Photographers list work when they started putting a camera in every phone.\n\nShould we not have invented the camera? Was it wrong to make cameras more accessible to everyone? \n\n>Also, why not be angry at those who enjoy the fruits of this new technology as well? You are busily working on our destruction, celebrating it even.\n\nBecause it doesn't help you. It just makes you seem like you are angry that someone else dare be able to profit selling images of you can't. \n\nAnd I'll definitely admit there is a subset of AI images creators that are aggressively celebrating anything that hurts traditional artists but let's not act like there are not traditional artists celebrating anything that takes away an AI artists ability to make a living off their work. \n\n>>If you are afraid of your art being built on that is just really sad.  The idea that something you create could help someone else create being  bad is terrible. Imagine if the old masters hid their works fearing that  some other painter might learn their technique.\n>\n>I have spent years of my life teaching other people how to draw and paint. For free. Why should I keep sharing NOW? \n\nI mean you don't have to, I just think it is really sad that someone who enjoyed making and sharing art feels like they shouldn't because it might contribute the tiniest fraction of quality to an AI image program. It sounds a lot like someone imagining this terrible thing and changing their life because of it when whether you share your work or not isn't very meaningful at this point. \n\n>You have your fancy new toy that can puke out images by the billions. \n\nI haven't generated  anywhere close to that. Definitely less than 100,000 images. I created them because I enjoyed it, some have been used as references for characters, other as desktop wallpapers, others for jokes between friends. Some we created just to see if I could achieve something specific. \n\n>I like creating my work, that's apparently the only thing I am allowed as an artist. Fame, money, prestige, all that is evil according to you guys. \n\nI don't think that very many people believe it is wrong to make money or acquire fame from being an artist.\n\nSome are overreacting to the hate they are receiving from artists and lashing out but that is a small minority. \n\nI also find it pretty alarming that you recognize the impact on you that people are suggesting your art is without worth and that you then turn around and suggest that all art made with tools you don't like is worthless. \n\n>So I'll just keep it to myself lest it would be used to feed the machine, being used to damage all other artists still trying to make a living. \n\nThe \"damage\" you do to AI by not sharing your work is non-existent. Many AI tools are being trained on already available works, some even off of tools only using public art. Others are being trained off of AI art itself or created by merging and editing existing models. \n\nWhat you are really doing is damaging your ability to have your work seen. If that isn't important to you whatever, I have no interest in sharing my art. I just think that you are changing your behavior because you believe something fundamentally false. \n\n>Also, that is literally how craftsmen operated in the past, it was the only way to stay free.\n\nThe world is so much better now that less skills are gated to some society of old craftsmen demanding tribute from anyone that dares to cobble a pair of shoes.\n\n***Edit 2***\n\n> You don't have any respect for the skill that goes into art. \n\nSure I do. I have the same respect that I do for anyone that has put a lot of work into a talent, be it art or sport or craft. \n\n>You don't have even an ounce of understanding what goes into creating an image, the years and thousands of hours spent.\n\nI think you have an extremely pretentious view of what art is. It's a skill, it's pretty impressive and it's a great way to express yourself. But it isn't some sacred thing. Knowing about old paintings and the people that painted them and the things that inspired them isn't more impressive than knowing the history of any other thing. \n\n>Especially your claim that some people can just gain their skills within a short time is ludicrous.\n\nI think that your idea of what art is is so limited that you probably legitimately believe this. That's sad. \n\n>Yes, there is geniuses everywhere, but they are rare and far in between. Even Kim Jung Gi, gifted with amazing skills of visualization, had to spend thousands of hours grinding basic perspective exercises until he could \"draw anything, from any angle\".\n\nThat isn't something you need to be able to do to be a great artist.

In a sense, that's sort of what this is doing: if those images were generated by Stable Diffusion, for instance, then Firefly would sort of be learning to be more like Stable Diffusion indirectly without accessing the original dataset or the input code.", "4138": "The 3 images generated doesn't match Kelly McKernan's style at all. \n\nNot to mention, the model is already done training.

Anyone can test this by uploading images to Adobe stock and then trying the AI and see that the newly uploaded images is not know by the AI. \n\nAlso, Any ML researcher will also tell you that the training images are processed and made sure it has proper Text image pairs and considering this is a commercial product, they likely stripped their database of Any modern artists from the image text pairs(at least those who did not opt-in). \n\nAn easy way to check if the AI has learned your style is to use your name as prompt. If the generated images matches the style, then the AI has used your art(then we can sue Adobe), if it doesn't then the Ai just generated a random image from the prompt. By virtue of how it works, we can enter a random string of letters and an image will still be generated.", "4139": "I need more information. Are they AI generated? Actually- that really isn't important. I'm going to make a point that applies either way, about understanding ourselves and what we \\*really\\* want from 'ethical AI' in the face of the things you can actually do with the technology.\n\nSo, this is only 3 images, which means someone who want's the AI to be promptable on the concept of Kelly Mckernan could easily have made these by hand using firefly's ethical model.\n\nAlso... you can put someone's images into an image to prompt generator for a system not trained on their images, then use that prompt. This usually doesn't give great results, but you'll get similar artists your system \\*is\\* trained on, and similar style words and elements and mediums.\n\nThen you can tune your results by hand and cherry pick the best one, and now you have a legally \"clean, ethical\" image that wasn't trained on someone's art, but does imitate their art.\n\nExcept, in a sense it \\*was\\* trained on their art. It's just that part of the \\*training\\* involved a step where a human brain breaks down the concepts instead of a machine brain. The assumption that humans will take longer to imitate your art and add it to an 'ethical' dataset, doesn't hold as well if those humans are also AI assisted.\n\nSo- I don't know whether this is what happened, or if something much more overt, like these being stable diffusion images from a Kelly Mckenan LoRA. But what I'm getting at is- we have to be very careful what we ask for when we ask for 'ethical art'.

Regardless of the size of the team, there's always a margin of error, especially when you have to deal with hundreds of images.\n\nIn my case, my margin of error is small, but sometimes AI slips through, and there're a couple of reasons for that to happen:\n\n1) Mental exhaustion.\n2) Distracting work environment.\n3) Bias if you already know the artist and their work.\n4) Ai generated art is easy to spot, but ai assisted art (art that's being enhanced with ai instead of purely generated) is not.\n5) The art style of many regular artists resembles what we are seeing with ai, which makes it hard to assess. You just have to see the amount of artists getting accused of using ai and it's just their art style.\n\nIn the case of this artist, the dude had history with WotC way before AI was a thing. Point 3 would be in effect here.\n\nThe art pieces, plural, were originally concept art already made and later passed through an AI. Point 4 in effect here.\n\nOne thing to remember is that art pieces need to be registered through the copyright house, which I assume is standard procedure for them. You have to present evidence that the work you're registering is indeed of your authorship. If they were able to present such evidence, then there wasn't further need of double-checking his work.\n\nIt goes without saying that there's a difference between purely generated art and ai assisted art since you can register the latter for copyright while the former cannot.

This sort of pure capitalist philosophy is one that assumes that increasing profits while lowering costs is always going to be in the best interests of society, but that isn't the case because so much of what benefits human society isn't something that can be measured in monetary terms.\n\nWhile I think there is definitely something being lost in the transition from handcrafted items to mass production, there is far less being lost in this case by the nature of what is being produced. Something like a chair still has practical value regardless of whether it's hand crafted or run off an assembly line and that is, ultimately the function for which it's purchased.\n\nArt, regardless of its medium, has a far less tangible value as an object. It's value lies not in its practical function, but in its ability to act as a vessel through which human experience can be communicated. I don't enjoy the movie Blade Runner because of any sort of value the individual components present, but because those components come together to tell me a story of what it means to be human, to immerse me in the experience of living in the dystopian future city it portrays and to make me think about how I see the world and expand my own understanding of it. And all of these things are the result of this film being made by humans making creative decisions and trying to translate their own experiences into a format that will resonate with other people. A generative LLM can't replicate that because it lacks a proper understanding of the experiences and ideas behind the words it's imitating, it can only look at strings of text and collections of pixels and recognize patterns of how they appear together.\n\nAn AI generated movie or piece of art might be able to draw people's attention, or get butts into seats, but it's ultimately not enriching the minds of its viewers because it can only recycle what has come before. Innovation and the communication of the human experience are important for society, but because you can't put a price tag on that it doesn't matter to the capitalist systems trying to use AI to exploit us.", "4635": "As a professional 3D artist the reason you are a hobbyist is your lack of mastery both technically and artistically.

I bring that up because there's a distinction to be made between art done for income and art done for personal reasons.

It's much more a reflection of myself, capturing a moment of my mind and putting it out into the world in a creative way.\n\nBecause of this my music resonates with me perfectly.  It's hard to explain but I'm sure other artists around here understand.  When I listen to other music I enjoy it of course.  The stuff I've put my heart into just matches my wavelength exactly though, it hits every note my mind wants to hear because it was crafted that way by me.  So my music ends up being something that truly reflects myself.

It's something I do enjoy but it's definitely a job, a kind of means to an end that while interesting and fun doesn't have a whole lot of heart to it after so many years of deadlines.  They'll be able to achieve art as a commodity in that way.\n\nThey won't be able to achieve art as an experience.\n\nEverything they attempt to put their heart into will come along with an \"as imagined by Stable Diffusion\" disclaimer.  Their thoughts and emotions regardless of how detailed their prompts are will be \"as depicted by Midjourney\".

The same trend will unfortunately occur in art.\n\nHumans are going to have to accept that making art or creative work by hand is going to be reduced to a hobby in the same way horse riding is today.", "4928": "What is Citizens United?", "4929": "In that case, your analogy doesn't line up. The transition from horses to vehicles was inevitable because: \n\n1. The \"horse industry\" existed for the sake of humans, not horses. \n\n2. Any contraction in the \"horse industry\" was more than made up for by new automotive manufacturing jobs.\n\nThere simply wasn't sufficient reason to stop this transition. Even taking this for granted, one car was only replacing one or two horses at a time. No one car could replace the entirety of all horses simultaneously. \n\nAI art is a different beat altogether because any one of these algorithms can and will cause mass material loss to potentially all artists, globally, without establishing a new employment field for them of any kind, let alone a proportionate one. \n\nGiven this, we have both the will and the means to not let artists become insolvent -- We simply don't allow AI assisted artworks to qualify for trademark protection. Trademark law exists to protect human produced works, not machine produced works. If AI assisted artwork cannot be trademarked, any corporation looking to protect its IP will have to use human labour. This won't be sufficient to protect all artists, but it's a big step to protecting the industry as a whole.   \n\n\nAlternatively, we can also stop this nonsense of corporations being able to increase profit margins thanks to automation without any relative compensation for the workers they've displaced. If we're finally reaching the stage of development where human labour is no longer necessary for economic productivity, It's asinine to be content with the most well-positioned capital holders sucking up what little wealth they don't already have and leaving the workforce to fight each other in an ever shrinking job market.

The art industry exists for humans, not artists, in the same way.  The fact of the matter is it is a tool that improves productivity to the same extent that factories improved manufacturing efficiency.  Or, are you going to suggest that it is wrong to use machinery to produce goods and that everything should still be handmade to protect the carpenters, cobblers, weavers etc that used to do that kind of work?  My heart goes out to the artists affected by technology they never dreamed would hit them the way it did, but this kind of thing has never stopped when it threatened to eat up other industries in the past.\n\n2. I explained this in 1, but job count is frankly not a part of the question when we are talking about productivity.  If that was a binding factor we would still be making everything by hand in order to assure as many jobs as possible.  In other words, find a different job (or use AI as a tool which many professionals are already integrating into their work flow.  I work at an AAA game studio and all of our concept artists are now using image generation in combination with their own paintings.)\n\nArtists are not a special exception to the rule.  Improvements to technology are not going to stop for you and any major company in creative fields is already working on AI in full force.  That\u2019s just the cold reality of the world we live in today.", "4932": "Not sure why you split your argument into 2 parts given it's essentially the same point both times, especially since neither part addresses either solution I proposed, but ok, here we go.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't line up. You just want it to.   \n\n\nIf your argument is that horses are to humans what artists are to humans... do I even need to finish this sentence to make it clear why that's wrong?  AI automation is not comparable to industrialization. Industrialization took one job, turned it into 5 jobs, and increased the productivity of each worker through specialization. AI automation doesn't turn art into a factory line, it bypasses the workers, altogether.   \n\n\nIndustrialization both increased the job market and increased productivity. AI automation replaces the job market. The only way you can conclude these things are equivalent is if you lack the ability to analyze these situations beyond \"both are a kind of change in the labour market!\" Yes, they're both a kind of change, but the way this changes things and how these changes stand to affect the market are unprecedented. It isn't sufficient to look at how things were a century+ ago and say, \"welp, I guess we're doing that again!\" You need to actually look at the specifics of what's happening.   \n\n\nJob count is always part of the question when we're talking about productivity, because productivity is defined relative to the labour that went into it. You're not only wrong matter-of-factly, this couldn't even be theoretically true. Making things by hand wouldn't increase the number of jobs, because labour costs would be too great to meet market demand and we'd have to revert back to people making their own things. You have a tremendously patchwork understanding of history and economics. Again, industrialization increased the job market, it didn't shrink it. \n\nIt's cool that your coworkers are implementing AI into their work, but what's your point? Actually, I really don't understand how you think this is relevant or helpful to your argument. Are you just making conversation?  \n\n\nYou're talking like because the changes that happened in the past weren't stopped, that means the changes that might happen going forward also cannot be stopped, but that's some seriously low-IQ analysis of the world. It's already not clear if AI art is protected under copyright law. As the law is written, it looks like it's not, but the courts will have to wrestle this one out. If they decide AI assisted artworks are not protected, that's the end of the great AI threat. If we decide AI generators are not legal for commercial purposes, that's the end of the great AI threat. If we allow corporations to use tools that effectively end and industry, but tax their new profits proportionately and put it towards some kind of UBI, then that's also effectively the end of the great AI threat. Do you get it? This is primarily a legal question, not an \"inevitable march of progress\" question.   \n\n\nArtists don't need some kind of special exemption, and we don't even need to stop AI image generators from existing. We just need to decide what the laws surrounding this new technology are and what any new ones should be, and if your opinion is that the law will fatalistically fall against labour, that's just your pessimism talking. That conclusion isn't borne out by any political, legal, or historical analysis of previous technological revolutions because there are none comparable to this. Thinking otherwise is just intellectual laziness.", "4933": "Why do AI bros think that everyone secretly desires to be unemployed and on UBI? I honestly don't get this.

Using the UBI as an example, if it is implemented as a result of AI taking A LOT of jobs, unless our governments are very diligent about regulation, everything will just get more expensive because corporations will see the UBI as extra money for them to squeeze out of people. \n\nIt's kind of funny, I actually think that this blindness to human messiness is part of the reason they're so adamant against learning to write/draw.

I'm just hoping to do work that I care about, and let the robots (or other people who do care) do the work I don't care about.\n\nWith robots, we no longer need humans to do stuff humans don't want to do, eliminating the need for jobs you can barely tolerate.  With UBI, you have a safety cushion if you need a bit more time to find that job you love, or a bit more money to make the finances make sense, or need to be able to eat while you get through college.\n\nThe obvious downside to this comes for the people who do love the jobs robots can automate (which will eventually be all jobs).  Why would a business owner take a risk on an expensive employee when a cheap robot can do the job fine?  This is absolutely a problem technology will make worse, but I think the issue is with the economy/system and not with technology.  One can imagine a world where I walk into a warehouse and the boss says, \"Well, we don't technically need you, but these robots provide way more money and productivity than we need to be sustainable, so sure.  You can join too.\"\n\nThe difficult part, of course, is how to make that happen.  How do we align business incentives to maximize human happiness instead of maximize profits?

A generative AI that has never generated or been trained on a cat before will need many, many pictures of cats in order to generate a good one, and it still doesn't have an idea of the bone structure or anything else of a cat, so it will still do things wrong.\n\nBoth humans and generative AI use pattern-seeking brains, because humans designed them, and that's the only way we know how to train something. Even dogs have pattern seeking brains. How you train a dog is like how you train a generative AI.\n\nTraining a generative AI is the same as training an ai to play trackmania, beat a Mario level, for rat braincells to play doom, and for a human to learn how to draw.

Annoying and entitled so I refuse to show off my best work in public spaces.", "5600": "Glaze works.  It fucking works. It does what it claims it does; which is to stop model add-ons that are specifically designed copy from small artists with low amount of works or extremely spesifict aspects from a body of works.\n\n The claim whether it works or not can be very easly tested. It's rather straight forward really: just repeat what a copier would do but add Glaze to the mix.\n\n To see the effect for myself; I have decided that I will be testing it with the illustations from the original book of \"Alice In Wonderland\" (Meh. \"Into The Mirror\" had a better story overall, just saying.) made by sir John Tenniel back in the day. It's okay, you can't really beat the classics. The guy knew what he was doing, everybody will know who is the real deal even in a sea of copycats and wanna-be's.\n\n I have choosen 15 illustrations from the original book that I thought would best represented what a mimic would look for. (You have to keep in mind that they often go for even lower numbers, so I was being very generous to the model.)\n\nSince this is a test of sorts; I had to also check how would it looked like if the artworks were not Glazed at all and the theft was successful. So in the end of the day, I had to make two LoRas (what they call the mimicry add-on in their circle): one with unprotected artwork and one with fully Glazed ones.\n\n Just to give an example, here is just one picture from the fully Glazed stash:\n\n[If I didn't told you this was Glazed, would you be able to even pick it up?]( Very skillful eyes may be able to pick up the artifacts Glazed had given to the artwork- But as you can see, specially on white surface, it is very hard to tell. Yet Glaze is still there and just as strong. Don't count on bros to be able to even pick up on it. The best part is you can set Glaze to look even be less intensive. And this example image was Glazed at max settings. It's visability only decreased over the course of the months it's been out, not increased. The end goal is to make it invisable to human eye as it gets while maximizing the amonth of contaminant noise models pick up on.\n\n It took a while, but I have decided to run the test on Stable Defusion, and I believe the results speak for themselves:\n\n[Examples of attempted mimicry with no Glaze.]( of attempted mimicry with full Glaze.]( As you can see for yourselves, Glaze causes a significant downgrade in the quality of the results, even if it's all black and white. To prove this isn't random, here is another pacth of examples:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Examples of attempted mimicry with no Glaze.]( of attempted mimicry with full Glaze.]( You will notice that it almost completely ruins the aesthetic models go for. If a theft were to try, one would not be able to pass the results coming from the model that was fed Glazed images as the real thing.\n\n Remember; the goal is to effect the models more than how much the it effects the images themselves and how much human eye can see. You should be able to see that how much the program changes and misguides the model is much greater than how much it changes the original. Really proves that there things really don't \"learn\" like we do at all.\n\n When bros are going around spewing \"16 lines of code\", they are lying to you and themselves- Because it only benefits them if artists were to give up on solutions provided them in the false belief of it being useless to try. It's actually very similar to the tactics abusers use. This is exactly why they have now switched from \"Glaze doesn't works\" to \"There is an antidote to Nightshade\" even tho it is not even publicly available for them to work on.  \n\n There is currently no available way to bypass what Glaze applies to a given image. \"De-Glazing\" doesn't really De-glazes anything because of how it works. Take it from the horse's mouth:\n\n[This is directly from the page of that very \\\\\"16 lines of code\\\\\".]( Honestly, the fact bros are going around, getting out of the woods to sneak in to artist communities in hopes of spreading their propaganda when they could have been relasing their \"solutions\" as peer reviewed papers speaks a lot. The claims they make is on the same level with urban legends at this point with nothing to show for; while Glaze won both the  Distinguished Paper Award at USENIX Security Symposium and 2023 Internet Defense Prize. These things are not being made up.\n\n There is, as in the moment of typing, no available way demonstrated with consistency to go around it.\n\n Even if a way is discovered, there is no way of knowing whether it can be quickly patched in an speed update as easly since there is a science behind it.  \n\n The only thing Glaze can't do right now is stop your images from being used as an basis for image2imaging- Because it's purpose was not to stop that. \\[But if you are interested, another team unrelated to University of Chicago's Glaze had released a program called Mist: ([ that is very similar in nature- But for today, I will not be focussing on Mist and proving it's credibility because it's not as accesible.\\]\n\n So, what are we doing now? We have to start applying Glaze to our valuable artworks with no segregation- (Assuming you don't want theft and mimics up your tail) To do that; you will have to go to their offical website ([ and download yourselves a local version of the program to run on your own computer if you have the hardware. If not, no worries! They have also thought of that! You can just sign up to their Webglaze program with a single email adress where you can get your works applied Glazed with computing part done else where, but your works still do not leave your computer.\n\n By the way, if you are going to start applying Glaze now, releasing the bare versions of any of your works would completely defeat the purpose because than bros looking into profitting off of you would just go for them instead. If you are commited everything that leaves you hand must have Glaze on them. I would even go as far as to say that you may even want to delete everything that is currently unprotected be just to be sure.\n\n Before I let you go; I want to also add that Glaze is being worked on by a team of experts 24 / 7 and being constantly updated and upgraded. It's current state is very different than what it was when the program was first released. I remember when it used to take 40 minutes to go over a single image- yet it is in almost light speed compared to than. It's also getting harder and harder to see.

I'll use it next time I need post something", "5602": "Question. How much computer memory does Glaze uses? How good does your computer needs to be? I ask because......my laptop is not the best.

Let's say you're aware that glaze is commonplace online and decide to perform some operations on those images to minimize its effect.  For example, what if you img2img the pic, upscale it 4x with low denoise, and then downscale it again, and use those as the basis of the lora?  I feel like such a method could be automated, if a model/lora creator was sufficiently paranoid.", "5607": "Thank you so very much for writing this all out and explaining it!\n\nI have a Mac computer and Glaze is super slow for me. I use Web Glaze: [ and the turnaround time is super fast for me. You'll have to contact them to get access, I believe. I did it through Twitter and I had to give them a link to my gallery (so I guess they knew I was a legit artist). They responded quickly and added me. I hear they are behind because of the vast interest in what they're doing, so maybe there is a more of a wait time now, I don't know.\n\nThe AI bros are always saying that \"Glaze doesn't work\" and right now I'm thinking, \"So?\" They remind me of the people who were so dead-set against anybody taking any precautions during the pandemic. It was this weird cope. Like I never told them what to do, but why do they care what ***I*** do? My taking precautions doesn't hurt anybody and are nobody's business. If I want to put my art through Glaze and I don't hate the way it looks, I'm going to do it. If it turns out it doesn't work? At least I took a chance and made an effort. Better than just throwing up my hands and doing nothing.\n\nBut I believe it works. I think you're right, I think the AI bro's insistence that it doesn't work, and their almost obsessive focus on it, always telling us \"it doesn't work, don't waste your time\" is sending a message, and it's not the message they hope to send. They're trying too hard, they're too bothered by it. If they didn't view it as a possible threat, I don't think they'd be talking about it as much as they do.

It's actually irrelevant how \"good\" it is. It's the same idea as outsourcing. There are amazing artists who work as outsource artists but that doesn't mean they will always meet the needs of a project. A company decides to outsource work, now they need to hire more people to oversee outsourced art, more people to create target assets that guide the outsource artists, etc. Not to mention implementation, handing things off to other departments for marketing and so on. You're offloading a lot of work, but you're also creating 10x more work that you need to have consistency with and quality control over. It's astronomically harder to get AI to change its output the way you want it to, much easier to say words or provide a paintover/redline to an outsource artist, even with a language barrier. Until that changes, which it won't because it fundamentally doesn't understand concepts, only tags from a database that won't get you far, you're going to do a lot of manual work with generative AI unless you don't care about quality. I imagine most places aren't going to drop their quality bar, or they'd already be hiring less qualified artists because they're cheaper and plentiful.\n\nThe stance Adobe is taking is that AI isn't going to eradicate the need for artists, it will just create more work and more people who will use AI and need for their products and services.\n\nOverall projects aren't getting smaller. They're getting bigger, and there are more and more of them. The more work they can get out the more money, but the work they get out needs to meet a certain threshold of quality. For example, if video games only used new tech to make their output more efficient and spend less money, why aren't all games the scale of Mario Bros. or Zelda 1 on NES? Those teams were only a handful of people.

Built on unethically sourced images from creators who didn't give consent. Took things artists treat very personally and fed them to a soulless algorithm. It feels extremely violating in a way that's hard to describe.\n\n\n2. Ugly. They always have a weird glossy sheen, fucked up fingers or other details, or otherwise just look uncanny and unappealing.\n\n\n3. It's spammed everywhere. Google images and art sites are flooded with this crap. It makes it harder to find anything genuine.\n\n\n4. It defeats the whole point of art. It's about the personal control and flair and show off skill and creativity, and communicating ideas in cool ways. AI just lets you skip all of that to get a picture. Yay.\n\n\n5. It's liked by twitter blue checkmarks. That's reason enough alone to hate something.\n\n\n6. It \"empowers\" the lazy. Sorry but lazy people being filtered by the difficulty of producing good art is a good thing. They don't deserve to receive great art if they aren't either willing to bust their ass or pay for it. Allowing to them just releases a floodgate for mediocre garbage to pour out.\n\n\n7. It further enriches corporations at the expense of workers. It's bad from an economical standpoint.\n\n\n8. It opens up massive potential for fraud. Consumers are tricked into paying  for art from fake artists. Consumers have rights to know what they are paying for. Any AI art should come with huge ugly watermarks that are impossible to remove to prevent this.\n\n\n9. It's devoid of any meaning. The most you can gleam from an AI picture is \"it looks nice\". You can't get any insight from it about the creator because there is no creator. That makes it inherently boring to anyone who ever thinks about art beyond face value. Also if somebody couldn't be bothered to create something, why should I care about it?\n\n\n10. It stifles human creative innovation and robs them of the rewarding journey of mastering a skill. It also stifles a monetary incentive to pursue it and as a result robs us of potential future great artists.", "5922": "My biggest gripe with AI \"art\" is that there's no progression. Seriously, when AI is in the question, where do you go from there? You've already compiled the best of humanity's rendering, details, lighting, etc into a model. Okay. But how do **YOU** improve as an artist?   \n\n\nWhen using AI, you are not improving your own lighting, expression, emotion, intention, shape, form, or gesture at all. There's no improvement, because you've already achieved what you perceive as \"perfection.\" And when there's no progression, there's no remembrance. Your \"art\" pieces are forgettable just based on the copious amounts that you can generate at any given time. I can bet you that AI bros probably don't even remember their first or second generation, because they are all forgettable. How about their 10th generation? 20th? 32nd? No, they don't remember what they \"made\", because there's no progression, which makes AI outputs instantly forgettable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing: many artists including myself do art just to see ourselves improve. People love seeing things improve; whether it be their physical health (fitness), their physical appearance (beauty), or their financial status (fiscal responsibility). People like self improvement, and art is no different.   \n\n\nI often ogle at artwork from artists like wlop, SamDoesArts, JP Art, and wonder: is it possible for me to create art just like them? Can I do that? The answer is obviously a resounding yes, as long as you put the time & effort into improving your artistic skill, which leads me to my other point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe often forget progression. We look at a piece of art and wish we could be that skilled, whilst not thinking of the progression of the artist. The artwork didn't procure out of nowhere. They were a novice just like all of us, and, using video game terminology here, \"leveled up\" their skill overtime with practice, studies, mentors, etc. Artists frequently recollect their art journey, reflecting on their past artworks, often laughing and criticizing their old works in a light-hearted manner. AI \"artists\" can't do that, because there is no progression. I mean, what is there to criticize? (that's what they think, us artists criticize their \"work\" all the time).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProgression also leads to love. When someone is committed to progressing their skill level, it is normally out of love for the art form. I didn't improve my video editing because I don't like video editing; I love video editing, so naturally, I'm going to seek out ways to improve my skill. All AI bros do is chase out the current hot-new extension available for automatic1111 (Stable Diffusion Web UI), which doesn't improve your skill; it just makes something that was already easy, even easier (eg.
