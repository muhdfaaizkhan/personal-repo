    "    - The `Vision` objects are used to detect the opponent Pokemon. Images are sorted into different folders based on the opponent Pokemon detected.\n",
    "4. At the same time, the keyboard inputs, date/time of recording and opponent's name are appended to their respective lists. Each recording of keyboard inputs is saved as a list of 7 integers, which indicate whether the respective key is pressed during the recording.\n",
    "    - Keys are recorded in this order: `['SPACEBAR', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', 'l']`. For example, a input recording of `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` indicates that the `d` and `k` keys were pressed during the time of recording.\n",
    "5. Inputs and images are recorded this way at an interval of 0.25 seconds.\n",
    "6. When the user terminates the collection function, all lists are combined into a single dataframe, with each input given its own column. The dataframe is then exported to the specified directory. Each row of the dataframe can be matched to its respective image by comparing the `time` column and the name of the image.\n",
