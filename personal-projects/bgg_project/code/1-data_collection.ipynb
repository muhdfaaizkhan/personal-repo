    "[Thematic Games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/5496/thematic-games): As described on the website, thematic games consist of games in which the overall game experience is driven primarily by a strong theme, much like a book or a movie. For thematic games, the game mechanics and rules are purposefully designed to simulate and complement the given theme, lending to a more immersive and engaging experience. This can be contrasted with [strategy games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/5497/strategy-games), for which the game mechanics prioritise player agency and decision-making instead. These games potentially compromise on theming and may lean into abstraction (see also [abstract games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/4666/abstract-games)) to provide a more strategic and intellectually-engaging experience.\n",

There are currently 5084 families on BGG, [at the point of writing](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamefamily/page/1). Including a categorical feature for each family will create a large but extremely sparse dataset, which may lead to overfitting. We can compare this to the relatively lower number of unique entries for both `mechanics` ([192 total](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamemechanic)) and `categories` ([84 total](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamecategory)).\n",
