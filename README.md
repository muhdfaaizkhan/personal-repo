## GA Projects
### [Capstone Project: Training Mode Start! Training a Deep Learning Model for an AI-Controlled NPC](https://github.com/muhdfaaizkhan/personal-repo/tree/65ac42cc6c843d681ef9a9a3a40112c69ef89f59/GA-projects/capstone_project)

Created an automated bot to play a fighting game using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

The model is trained on pre-recorded data consisting of screenshots from the game and the corresponding inputs made by the player when the screenshot was captured. A CNN model was trained using **PyTorch** to predict the appropriate inputs for a given screenshot. A Python script uses the OpenCV library to collect screenshots from a running instance of the game to perform predictions and inputs in real-time.

### [Project 4: Optimising Hospital Bed Occupancy through Machine Learning](https://github.com/muhdfaaizkhan/personal-repo/tree/65ac42cc6c843d681ef9a9a3a40112c69ef89f59/GA-projects/project_4)

Developed a prediction model for the occupancy rate of the public hospital NUH, so as to guide efficient allocation of manpower and inventory for acute inpatient cases.

Multiple machine learning methods were explored in the process of developing the prediction model. Among the tested machine learning models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network using **Keras/TensorFlow** was found to be the most accurate in performing predictions. 
A Streamlit app was built to predict bed occupancies for NUH within a 3-month period using the developed model.

### [Project 3: Generative AI and Art - Understanding and predicting chatter from online communities](https://github.com/muhdfaaizkhan/personal-repo/tree/65ac42cc6c843d681ef9a9a3a40112c69ef89f59/GA-projects/project_3)

Developed a classification model that predicts whether a Reddit post supports or opposes Generative AI art.

Two subreddits were identified where posts were mostly supportive (_[r\DefendingAIArt](https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt)_) or opposing (_[r\ArtistHate](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistHate)_) Generative AI art. The posts from these subreddits were scraped using Reddit's API and were used to train multiple machine learning models using **Scikit-Learn**. The Multinomial Naive Bayes model was selected by comparing key metrics for each model. This model was implemented in a Streamlit app, to compare the sentiments of 2 different Reddit threads towards Generative AI art.

### [Project 2: Kaggle Challenge: Singapore Housing Data](https://github.com/muhdfaaizkhan/personal-repo/tree/65ac42cc6c843d681ef9a9a3a40112c69ef89f59/GA-projects/project_2)
Developed a prediction model for the resale cost of a HDB unit as part of a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dsi-sg-project-2-regression-challenge-hdb-price/overview).

A linear regression model using **Scikit-Learn** was used for the project. Among the 70+ different features in the dataset provided by Kaggle, extensive data cleaning and feature engineering was done to improve the predictive ability of the model.

### [Project 1: Exploring Climate Data of Singapore](https://github.com/muhdfaaizkhan/personal-repo/tree/65ac42cc6c843d681ef9a9a3a40112c69ef89f59/GA-projects/project_1)
Analysed trends in Singapore weather and their relationships with the number of dengue cases, to optimise scheduling for the release of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes as part of NEA's Project Wolbachia.

Using data visualisation techniques in **Python**, dengue cases were found to spike approximately 1 month after rainfall and temperature spikes. With this information, the release of mosquitoes by NEA can be optimised by coinciding the release with predicted seasons of higher rainfall.
